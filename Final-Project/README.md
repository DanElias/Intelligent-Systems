# Amazon Food Reviews Classification for an Intrinsic and Extrinsic Product Quality Assesment

This project classifies Amazon Food Reviews into two categories based on their contents;
- Intrinsic: if the review talks about food attributes that are inherent to the product itself and cannot be manipulated without affecting its physical properties (e.g. color, taste, smell).
- Extrinsic: if the review talks about attributes that are not physically a part of a product (e.g. advertising, brand image).
