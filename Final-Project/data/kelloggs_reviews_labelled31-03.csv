Just enough sugar and alot less than any other regular frosted flakes I used to eat before being diagnosed celiac.,i
Product stays crisp in the box withouth resealing.,e
And stays crisp in a bowl of milk.,i
It is not often that a gluten free product exactly mimics the mainstream item but this one certainly does.,i
Tip: The manufacturer makes the same product for adults but it costs more So get this one the Kidz version,e
I have Celiacs disease and must eat a gluten free diet or I get very ill.,i
It is great to find a cereal that NEVER makes me ill It is 100 gluten freeI also love the taste of this gluten free cereal This cereal is like corn flakes but without being boring In fact I mix them with plain puffed rice to lessen the fruity flavor because I like milder tastes and do not have a big sweet tooth.Anyway I love this cereal and highly recommend it to people on gluten free diets...BUT if you can eat whole grain cereals like wheat and oats EAT THOSE INSTEAD because they contain FIBER which is very needed in keeping your digestive tract healthy.This cereal is created and designed for those of us who cannot eat whole grains.MY FAVORITE CEREAL MIX:1.,i
Amazon FlakesThe mixture is SO good that even nonCeliacs want to eat it,i
Nature's Path Organic Mesa Sunrise Cereal is a delicious alternative to corn flakes.,i
It has a heartydelicious flavor.,i
It contains quinoa the revered grain of the Incas and amaranth the health grain of the Aztecs For a cold cerealit's quite good.,i
It also makes a great snack Take a biteand imagine the mesas and canyons.,e
This cereal is very good but somewhat hard to find in the store.,e
It has a flavor that I can't quite describe somewhat more subtle than regular corn flakes.,i
The flakes are thick and crispy even with milk and not overly sweet.,i
I really really like these but can't get them a lot of the time unless I run to a local coop...and even then they don't always have them sadly.I would recommend trying this cereal out if you are gluten free or cutting back on wheat and get tired of rice cereals.,e
Its an added plus that its organic and has flax in it because flax is very good for you.,i
But then I've had good luck with products by Nature's Path and this is no exception.,e
A pack of six seems like a lot of cereal but not for a family and I do think that they will appeal to most kids.,e
At least kids who don't expect it to be as sweet as many other breakfast cereals and getting used to eating less sugar is a good thing anyway.These make me want to try out other products made with amaranth...,i
I like black pepper.,i
When I cook I grind my own and use as much as is called for by the recipe.,i
On those recipes that I consider keepers and decide to tweak one of the most freqent changes I make is to add more pepper.,i
I tell you all this so you will understand that I'm not a Casper Milquetoast who can't tolerate anything spicier than corn flakes.,i
I am fond of spicy foods and when I order them in restaurants I do NOT tell the waiter Mild please.The idea of putting pepper on nuts is I think a good one and could work well.,i
But there is just too much pepper in these.,i
And not a little too much a LOT too much.The nuts themselves seem fine.,i
Nice and fresh with good texture.,i
I think the amount of salt is good but that's difficult to determine with taste buds overwhelmed by pepper.If Emerald would use a quarter to a half as much pepper I think this could be a winner.,i
Fiber One Raisin Bran Clusters are simply put delicious.,i
Fiber One took a great type of cereal and made it taste much much better than the other Raisin Bran cereals out there.,i
In addition this cereal is truly chock full of dietary fiber.,i
It tastes great in milk and it even makes a good snack for when you're on the go.In addition the cereal has potassium iron and zero cholesterol.,i
ExcellentUnfortunately however all this goodness comes at a price.,e
There's a lot of dietary fiber; but this also contains a comparatively level of carbohydrates in each portion.,i
Perhaps you think that 45 grams of carbs per cup is OK; and maybe it is if you don't have a diet filled with carbs the rest of your day.,e
Compare it to Cheerios or Quaker Oats however and you'll see right away you can get other healthy cereals that are quite good for you with far fewer carbs and much less sugar.,i
Oatmeal has good dietary fiber too although not as much as this cereal has.Overall Fiber One Raisin Bran is probably the best raisin bran cereal I've ever eaten.,i
It's great; but because of certain health issues I wouldn't actually eat this every day unless you need carbs for some reason.,i
It's a mixed bag type of product.,e
Eat this and enjoy it; but also switch off between this and other healthy cereals like Cheerios and Quaker Oats.,i
This cereal is so tasty  it seems like you are eating one of those notgoodforyou sugary cereals that kids love.,i
They are very similar to Cinnamon Toast Crunch.,i
They do have a slight healthy taste but it's hardly noticable.,i
Even the kid's will enjoy this cereal which has an amazing amount of fiber in it  especially to taste so good not like sticks I used to eat raisin bran b/c it had 7g of fiber and still tasted okay.,i
Now I eat this which has 9g of fiber and tastes awesomeI highly recommend it.,i
Oh and the squares are small about 1/2 the size of CTCrunch so it's the perfect size for toddlers to pick up and eat.,e
They'll think they are eating candy but you'll know it's good for them ;,i
If you're looking for a more adult version for raisin bran be sure to try this.,i
The flakes remain crunchy for quite some time the raisins are larger and more frequent and it's packed full of vitamins.,i
Great great stuff even my cat likes it so hey you can't beat that  We consume quite a bit of this stuff in our house.,i
Highly recommend,e
Our family has always had Raisin Bran in the house so I was intrigued by the great reviews on TOTAL Raisin Bran  wanted to try it.,i
When comparing the raisin brans Amazon carries notice the BOXES vary in size ounces and the NUMBER of boxes in an order also vary as does the cost.We LIKE raisin bran and Post is probably our favorite because it has branny bran flakes and less raisins than Kellogg's which claims two scoops on the box.,e
Kellogg's has great bran flakes also but too many raisins IMO.,i
That brings us to Total Raisin Bran which seems to have about the same amount of raisins as Post but the FLAKES are completely different from both Kellogg's and Post.,i
Total Raisin Bran flakes are much larger and more crispy than the others but do not TASTE like BRAN flakes and seem a little bland by comparison.So Total is a lighter raisin bran in flavor and would be great for kids or people new to raisin bran or for people who want less distress from the fiber because Total has LESS fiber per cup than the others.,i
Kellogg's has 8 grams fiber per cup Post has 7 and Total has 5.So Total Raisin Bran is a great value 6 boxes in the order but it is not like traditional American raisin bran  if you're looking for less fiber less branny taste and large crispy flakes and great value Total is it,e
Total Raisin Bran is perhaps the best raisin bran cereal on the market.,e
The cereal is fortified so it supplies 100 of the daily Bvitamins as well as 100 of zinc iron and calcium.,i
The bran flakes are crisp and remain crisp a lot longer in milk.,i
Other raisin bran have flakes that quickly turn to mush when doused with milk.,i
Finally there are enough raisins in the mix so that one does not have to add extra raisins.,i
Perhaps best of all the cereal tastes good as well  although this is undoubtedly due to the added brown sugar and white sugar.,i
160 calories a serving.Most stores sell this product for about 4.25 a box.,i
This combo deal gives the buyer 6 boxes for just less than 4 bucks a box this does not include shipping charge.,e
All cereals have a long shelf life so if this is a favorite cereal several of these 6packs could be purchased and stored.kone,e
one factor that Total raisin bran is one abpve the rest of the pack is that the flakes maintain its flakes longer when immersed in milk.,e
Delecious and great value from amazon.,e
We have tried all the typical brans including ones from the health food store ... this is the one.,e
This is delicious cereal no doubt about it: the slices of freezedried real fruit ensure that.,i
It has plenty of fiber too and is free of artificial ingredients.It's a little crunchier than average: harder than corn flakes but not as toothcrunchingly hard as Kashi GoLean Crunch.I love the packaging: a simple recyclable brown cardboard box with a little colored ink.,i
I don't need my breakfast cereal in glossy packages.,e
Although it is sweetened with natural cane sugar 17g is a lot for a single serving when for example Kashi's Cinnamon Harvest comes in at 9g and still tastes plenty sweet for me.,i
I can't help think that given the real fruit in this Summer Berry Blend they could have gotten by with quite a bit less sugar.So I'd recommend this as a cereal for someone with a sweet tooth.,i
It's for someone who wants to eat healthier cereal but can't seem to stay away from the Chocolate Frosted Sugar Bombs.,i
Back to Nature Summer Berry Blend cereal tastes very good.,i
These are are thick sugar frosted brown sugar and honey corn flake shape multigrain pieces wheat and barley with freeze dried chunks of raspberries strawberries and blackberries in order of how frequently I found various pieces interspersed throughout.,i
It holds up very well to milk staying crunchy for a long time and the fruit pieces swell up to almost real size.,i
The fruit really tastes natural and tangy in your mouth.,i
No one in my family disliked the taste but my health conscious son objected a bit to the 17g of sugar per 55g serving he did like the 5g of protein per serving though.,i
Given the taste and only 5 out of 210 calories per serving coming from fat the rest of us were willing to let that go.I tried the cereal dry as a snack food and it works here very well also.,i
After about three fistfuls though the sugar content really does come through strongly.,i
Keeps you from eating too much?There is a money back guarantee if you don't love it.,e
My box which I received in December '08 had a 5 rebate offer which expired in November '08 though.,e
Because there are no artificial preservatives used the best by data was only three months into the future Feb 24 09.In summary I and the family liked it a lot even though it might not be strictly a health food due to the high sugar contents.,i
Bottom line it tastes very good.,i
Unlike some other cereals with only little bit of fruits this cereal has lot of fruits in the box.,i
The flakes seem harder larger and crunchier than the convention corn flakes.,i
It didn't taste too sugarish yet it's not void of sugar.,i
I had the cereal sent to my office.,e
I was goin to take it home for the family to try out but after tasting it i think i'll be greedy and keep it in my office for me to consume.,e
Though natural and very tasty this has too much sugar for my tastes or for a healthful breakfast.,i
It's similar to frosted flakes on the sweetness scale...,i
There's plenty of whole natural fruit though which is rare even in premium cereals.I liked it best when mixed about 50/50 with Cheerios or Shredded Miniwheat.,i
I got this thinking granola and wound up with something that is more like frosted flakes.,i
Not quite that bad.,i
But the sugar content on this stuff is a bit high and the flakes seem to be crunchy primarily because they have a lot of sugary coating.So why 4 stars?,i
LOADS of freeze dried strawberries and raspberries.VERY nice flavor if a bit too sweet in my books.,i
Don't let the box fool you this is not some slightly sweet trail mix.,e
This would be a 5star except for the sugar content.,i
If you don't care about that this is great.It tastes great; the dried strawberries add a nice flavor  better than a raisin bran for my tastes.The ingredients are healthful  whole grains et al.Unfortunately the sugar content is too high to consider this a truly healthful breakfast cereal.,i
It comes from sources like honey and brown sugar and the berries but nonetheless its a lot of empty sugar calories.,i
It's consistent with the nutrition label of other sweetened healthy cereals like some of the kashi sweeter cereals for instance or a whole grain raisin bran.For a healthier alternative with lower sugar content try Kashi's Go Lean for instance  no fruits but same fiber / whole grain and much less sugar.But again this was really good if you don't care about that.,i
I like this cereal.,i
It is better than the fruit in flakes cereal I buy at the local big chain grocery store as far as amount of fruit size of fruit and consistency of flakes are concerned.,i
By consistency I mean that the flakes stay crisp in milk.,i
I tend to eat slowly and the flakes in this cereal stayed crisp to the last bite.,i
Yes I timed it and I took 8 minutes to eat 3/4 cup in milk and the flakes didn't get soggy.,i
There is a large amount of dried fruit in this cereal and I think maybe that has something to do with the HIGH sugar grams The special k with dried berries I buy at the local market has 9 gms of sugar per serving.,i
But it also has about 1/2 the amount of berries and they are smaller.,i
I like the Back to Nature brand.,e
It is very sweet and I am more likely to eat it as a snack then as a meal.,i
But it is worth buying.,e
From comparing the nutrition labels it seems healthier than the other product in my cabnet.,i
I gave this product 4 stars instead 5 for two reasons.,i
1 The rasberries are slightly for lack of a better word overly tart.,i
And 2I don't know what I would do with six boxes of it  Wow that is a lot at one time.,e
I only recieved one box thank goodness I really like the product but only 2 of us live in the house.,e
If I could buy it in individual boxes I definitely would purchase this product.,e
If you are looking for a good tasting healthy cereal keep looking.,i
This particular cereal does have whole grains and some fiber without trans fats and high fructose corn syrup but that's where healthy ends.,i
There are SIX different kinds of sugar in this cereal plus the concentrated sugar you get in dried fruits.,i
The flakes are as sweet if not sweeter than many popular kid cereals.,i
The ingredients list barley syrup concentrated grape juice molasses honey evaporated cane juice and brown sugar.,i
That's a lot of sugar.,i
I compared this cereal to other cereals in my pantry.,e
I converted all of them to the same number of grams per serving so my comparisons would be meaningful.,i
In nutritional value this cereal was close to Lucky Charms and Leaping Lemurs an organic version of peanut butter Kix.,i
The Lucky Charms had more sugar and less fiber.,i
For a 50g serving of Back To Nature Summer Berry Blend Cereal you get 191 Calories; 1g Fat; 42g of Carbs with 15g of that in Sugar.,i
You also get 5g of Fiber but it doesn't state whether that fiber is soluble or insoluble.,i
Finally there are 5g of Protein and 91g of Sodium.How does the cereal taste?,i
The flakes are very hard/crisp and very very sweet.,i
It made me think of eating a really hard frosted flake with sugar added.,i
The fruit is freeze dried without any additional sugar so it is tart but there is still sugar in the fruit concentrated fructose.,i
I put soy milk on the cereal and let it sit for a minute and the flakes were still hard.,i
I tried rinsing some flakes in warm water to take some of the sweetness out but that left warm tasteless squishy flakes that were still sweet.If you like Very sweet cereal with a light malted barley taste you'll like it.,i
Just remember that it full of sugar and the sugar/fiber ratio is not good.,i
If you are attracted to it because it says Natural remember that there are no regulations on the use of the word Natural in the food industry and the cereal does list any ingredients as organic.,e
I have to admit I did like the flavor and I liked the extreme crunch.,i
However I threw away most of the box of cereal to keep from eating it because of the high sugar content.,i
Don't let the dried berries in this cereal put you off...coming out of the box they are puffedrice light and taste tart and grainy.,i
Moral of the story: don't eat this cereal out of the box dry.,e
But pour milk on it...what a difference.,i
The berries absorb liquid becoming much closer to the effect of having fresh berries on your cereal with lots of berry flavor but the best part is that as the berries are absorbing the milk the flakes are NOT.,i
These multigrain flakes are thick and crunchy and have wonderful flavor and texture.,i
For once a flake cereal that can be eaten leisurely with time to taste the coffee in between bites without having to bolt down the bowlful in a race against the typical corn flakes soggies.Note for those who need to watch sugar content: this cereal is sweetened with a combination of malted barley syrup evaporated cane juice molasses grape juice concentrate and brown sugar.,i
Serving size is one cup 210 calories per serving with 17 g total sugars.,i
Each serving also provides 5 g fiber and 5 g of protein.,i
Sodium is relatively low compared to other cereals at 100 mg per serving for comparison 1 cup Cheerios has 190 mg 1 cup rice Chex has 240 mg and 1 cup Kellogg's Raisin Bran has 350 mg sodium.,i
For many reasons I really liked this snack.,e
First the 2 crisps are only 100 calories.,i
For a 100 calorie snack this really satisfied my snack attack.,i
It does taste a little like a pop tart but without the icing on top and not quite as rich in the fruity flavor.,i
I found myself wondering what other flavors these came in.,i
I will definitely have a box on hand at work for my 3 pm food craving.,e
For a 100 calorie snack I highly recommend these.,i
These are great They do remind me of a pop tart but much crisper and lighter.,i
There is no dry cardboard taste.,e
The apple cinnamon flavor inside is also very good and fruity.,i
Some might find it a little chewy but I think it's great and goes well with the outside crust.,i
A nice snack or quick breakfast and you can't beat only 100 calories.,i
The other flavors are also very good.,i
I really enjoyed these fruit crisps.,i
I decided to give them 4 stars instead of 5 because they could be just a little juicier inside and a little healthier like whole grains.,i
But for those two things I am really impressed with these.There are two crisps in each package roughly 1 1/2 by 3 1/2.,e
They look vaguely like a pop tart though I'm not fond of those with some cinnamon sugar on the top that adds flavor and texture.,i
Inside is some fruit filling which is a little dry compared to the normal fruit newtons but at the same time really good.,i
It's not sickly sweet like some snacks but not bland either and being like dried apple the filling itself is a pleasantly chewy.,i
The overall flavor is cinnamon appley like an apple turnover but not buttery.,i
I know my kids will love these.,i
I do like the crispness compared to pop tarts and neatly formed crust.Good for on the go snacks for adults kids lunches afternoon snacks etc.,i
Thumbs upOnly 50 calories 4 grams of sugar and 1 gram of fat per bar.,i
And 16 bars packaged in twos per package.,e
Alas no fiber per serving.,i
Good thing they're packaged in sets instead of loose or they might get snarfed up too quickly.,e
First bite was like a cross between a pop tart and a cracker in texture.,i
Crunchy then chewy making it satisfying as a munchy.,i
Just for kicks I warmed one up in the microwave for 5 seconds tastes like apple pie would compliment ice cream and goes very well with hot tea.,i
Perfect when you want something sweet and crunchy at the same time.,i
Like a lot of other people I would like them better with a little more filling otherwise I have no complaints.,i
They look a little like a pop tart but much better tasting.,i
make a nice on the go snack for busy people.,e
For 100 calories these are great little snacks  They remind me of pop tarts a crunchy pastry with an apple cinnamon filling.,i
They are not too sweet but are actually sweeter than most of the 100 calorie snacks I have tried.,i
Although I wouldn't say they were exactly a healthy snack they don't contain any artificial sweeteners which is a plus for me and they contain real fruit.,i
I really enjoyed mine with a cup of coffee in the morning a great alternative to a pastry or doughnut and certainly healthier than either of those.All in all Newtons Fruit Crisps Apple Cinnamon were very tasty and they are low in calories if you are reaching for a snack and watching your calories this would be a good snack to reach for.,i
I thought that these have a good taste and the batch I received where crisp.,i
It was like eating a crunchy Fig Newton with Apple flavoring instead of the Figs.,i
Though for my taste it was light on the apple.,i
The apple shows up halfway down the ingredient list.,i
They almost taste like a thin pop tart with the type of crust you find on a baklava.These would be perfect for a snake that is low on calories.,i
For 100 calories you get two bars in each foil pouch.,i
But they contain no protein so they are carbs and sugar.,i
So if you are trying to stay away from carbs you will not want these.,i
I personally would eat them and enjoyed doing so.,i
But would not go out of my way for them.,e
The short version of this review is that a kid will probably love these right out of the box but for an adult they're kind of bland.,e
If you toast them lightly and/or dunk them in milk cow or soy they're quite good.And now the long version: I want to watch what I eat.,i
So when I have a snack it needs to be efficient.,e
It needs to have a satisfying flavor as well as satisfying the actual hunger.,i
I had a situation where I had to skip a meal but I had a pack of these in my purse.,e
So I ate it and it quieted my hunger until I was able to get an actual meal.,i
So it works for me as a snack that satisfies hunger.The portions here do seem rather small when you look at them.,e
They seem almost flimsy when you hold them and when you bite they do crunch but it also flattens out under your teeth.,i
They don't crumble much so they don't make a big mess.When you eat it alone the crust tastes a bit like raw pop tarts.,i
Which is actually how I used to eat pop tarts when I was a kid.,e
A child's taste buds are different from an adult's I think young kids would really like Newtons Fruit Crisps raw.,i
As an adult I found them a little dry and kind of bland until I hit the filling.,i
The apple filling is really good the more you chew the better it tastes.,i
Which is good because that gets you in the habit of eating slower really chewing up your food and taking time to taste what you're eating.Since they reminded me of pop tarts I put them in my toaster oven on the lightest toast setting and had them with vanilla soy milk.,i
Toasting improved the taste and texture of the crust quite a lot.,i
I highly recommend them that way.I suppose it's possible I just got a somehow undercooked batch but I doubt it.,e
So since I need to toast it to really bring out the flavor Newton's apple cinnamon fruit crisps get three stars because it's not quite as convenient as I would want from a prepared snack.,i
This is a toaster pastry pop tarts which comes in 1.5 x 3.5 inch little bars.,i
It has crunchy outer crisps covering the inner fruity Apple Cinnamon.,i
It tastes raw if you eat this without toasting them.,i
Toasting adds a little extra flavor and the warm crisps feels and tastes good.,i
I did not find anything great when I compare this product with other toaster pastries available in the market.,e
I hope you are fan of pop tarts and appreciate the taste of this snack.1.KELLOGG SNACKS KEEBLER 31132 POP TARTS CINNAMON FLAVORED TOASTER PASTRIES 3.67Oz.2.KEB31732  Kelloggs Pop Tarts Toaster Pastries Strawberry3.KELLOGG SNACKS KEEBLER 3800019721 POP TARTS Pack of 64.Nature's Path Organic Frosted Strawberry Toaster Pastries 12Count Boxes Pack of 65.Nature's Path Organic Frosted  Cherry Pomegranate 6Count Box Pack of 126.Nature's Path Organic Toaster Pastries 24 Strawberry  12 Blueberry Frosted Total 36 counts,i
my whole family liked these.,i
They are similar to pop tarts but without the icing all the calories and with a crisper fresher taste.,i
I enjoyed a pack of them with a cup of hot herbal tea for a late afternoon snack.,e
Kind of like a diet apple pie snack.,i
A nice addition to the growing 100 calorie snack line up.,i
I will be buying and trying these again.5 stars.,e
Nabisco's new Fruit Crisps may not be the most satisfying snack one could find.,e
But as snacks go it is a nice alternative to chips pretzels and similar snacks.Fruit Crisps look like a small version of pop tarts but are lighter and tastier.,i
The cracker like coating is indeed crispy and delicious.,i
It has a nice texture and crunch and almost approaches a pie crust like consistency.The apple filling resembles a jelly more so than a fruit filling.,i
The flavor is fair and sweet but appears to be more a mix of flavors than pure apple.,i
This is probably to be expected in a snack like this that needs to have some shelf life.Nutritionally Fruit Crisps are closer to chips and pretzels than a true fruit.,i
One pack provides fewer calories than most junk foods  however which makes the new produce appealing.,i
for something quick and for those on the go Fruit Crisps delivers ,e
Nabisco Newtons Apple Fruit Crisp snacks are reminiscent of pop tarts but are thinner and have a different texture.,i
They are slightly crispy and delicious; however there is very little of the sweet yet tart filling which tastes much like fresh apples.,i
Each pack contains 100 calories and one just doesn't seem to be enough.,i
Heating for a few seconds improves the flavor.,i
I thoroughly enjoyed every bite of this tasty little snack but think more filling would greatly enhance the product.,i
I am a Fig Newton fan so I was looking forward to these crisp snacks as something to satisfy that snack craving that hits me midway between lunches and goinghome time.,e
What I really want is a tasty bag of fatty potato chips but that is never good for you and fresh fruit just isn't really what I want.These snacks are...OK.,e
They are a little bland and taste better toasted than they do just out of the pack but are more of a morning snack than an afternoon one.,i
The apple/cinnamon flavor is perfect for a cold morning but I am not much of a breakfast snacker so they don't really fit the bill.While not exactly healthy they aren't really bad for you either.,i
They aren't incredibly delicious but they don't taste bad.,i
They just sit right in the middle in everything.,e
If you are looking for something to toast and snack on in the morning they would be great; a healthier version of pop tarts.,e
I'm actually a diabetic; and cereal because of it's high glucose content is usually something I stay away from.,i
If I eat cereal for breakfast even the good cereals like corn flakes or cheerios I see a sudden spike in blood sugar and usually get tired at around 10 or 11am.,i
These Nature's Path Cereals this one and the granola are the only cereals from which I experience absolutely no negative effects.,i
Because of the natural ingredients pumpkin seeds flax etc.,i
this cereal does not immediately turn to sugar for the body to process.,i
Instead it leaves you feeling full and energized for a long time.,i
They taste incredible too; seriously I prefer this over regular raisin bran or whatever you'd compare it to.,i
Strongly recommend,e
I believe these are the cookies when I was in grade school that they sold as a snack in small packages along with cheezits..when I saw these here..i was surprised..did not know that they still made them..as I have not ever seen this particular kind in the grocery stores.,e
they are very thin flat biscuits filled with raisins and crunchy..they are in the package in one long piece..you can break them to whatever size you would like..they are not too sweet at all..enjoyable.,e
So my parents were visiting and happened to give my 18 month old some corn pops.,e
I have never seen a kid eat things so fast so I decided to google an organic type of corn pop.,i
Now don't get me wrong I LOVE the peanut butter and the peanut butter and chocolate cereals from EnviroKidz so I thought the Gorilla Munch should be good.,i
I still have 3 boxes left in the pantry.,e
My kids don't want it it was kind of bland I wasn't impressed with the flavor.,i
I will continue to buy EnviroKidz but just not this type.,e
We have switched to an all Organic diet for our son with autism and it is hard to find kid  friendly cereals.,i
While I am not certain if the sugar content may be high as one reviewer disliked  it is an all natural sugar and not highfructose corn sugar or GMO modified beet sugar  So I am happy and feel good about letting our little one enjoy this cereal  It stays super crunchy in milk or soy milk...PLUS it is gluten free and my husband can enjoy it as well:Also this is not a peanut butter flavored cereal as some people have reviewed  it taste like Kix or corn pops,i
So its very hard to find an organic cereal in rural Vermont that doesn't cost a fortune so I was very happy to find these on Amazon.,e
Beware they taste a lot like cocoa krispies and are addictive  I had 4 bowls on Saturday alone...,i
They are good for a sweet treat just be sure you have more selfcontrol than I do,i
Well what can you say?,e
Been eating these over 50 years..a nice basic cereal low in sugar...take a break from corn flakes and give these a try..esp if you can get on sale.,i
the cereal has a different texture than any others I've had like chocolate or berry.,i
kind of reminds me of rice crispies.,e
I think i'll stick to my favorite special k and order chocolate from now on.,i
Out of cereal?,e
Kids don't like pop tarts?,e
Still want to get them a giant serving of sugar before sending them to school?,i
...I guess it's best if I don't address this company's allusion to this being like eating a real apple every day.It annoys me that companies try to say things are healthier than they are and it annoys me even more that people allow themselves to believe such claims without a further thought.,i
Regardless I'm still eating this stuff on occasion: it tastes good.,i
I'll be using it to replace my occasional want for a cake or cookie though instead of as daily breakfast.Interestingly they say the pack is now suitable to measure the milk or water that you add.,i
Not a bad idea even if a little dangerous.,i
i really like this corn flake granola almond thing that is going on in this box.we got 10 boxes 18 oz each for like 2.00 flat a box one day using subscribe andsave.,e
no close expiration date.does not taste chalky or like kelloggs fat free granolait is moist in the mouth/no strange after effectsit rates a 5 and is not generic for this value pricewith free shipping and no tax / the store never has this price,e
These Big Nut Bars taste like rice krispie bars with nuts so if you like rice krispies and nuts you'll definitely like these bars.,i
The bars are very filling and appetizing and since they are pretty high on protein content as well they make an ideal postworkout food.,i
They can also be used as mealsubstitutes or a healthy snack for any time of day.,i
i agree with some others who LOVE them..........these are much better than the usual normal just regular cheezits.,i
get em  don't know if i will share them or not  heh.,i
This is a really tasty snack cracker.,i
My kids love to eat these right out of the box but we really like them over tomato soup they're also great adding 1 cup to homemade chex mix.,e
Another favorite is to finely crush 1 cup hot  spicy cheezits and mix into 2lbs of ground beef I add a little worchestershire sauce one egg and some garlic salt and then make my own hamburger patties.,e
It makes 8 quarter lb patties.,e
They are fantastic that way and everyone will love your hamburgers.,e
If you want a little more kick then add pepper jack cheese but we just use american slices.,i
These are our favorite of all the cheezits.Just a note that this is the 9oz box and not the normal 13.7oz box so just beware when comparing prices at the grocery.,e
I love snacking on cheezits and a good or better aged cheddar cheese together with a mustard and sliced pepperoni.,i
My grandsons love Oreo cookies.,e
They also love pop tarts.,e
So what better combination than these Oreo flavored pop tarts for a treat now and then  They are away at school so these are great for sharing too,e
These are the second best flavor for pop tarts.,i
I was initially worried that these would be a major FAIL like the red velvet pop tarts but these are surprisingly good.,i
this is really delicious and it's better in cerealmy favorite is natural corn flakes than honey.,i
the flavor is really nice it doesn't overpower anything it just adds a nice flavor.,i
i use it in baking on fruits etc.,i
i've continually ordered it from amazon.,e
This really is a yummy cracker.,i
My kids love goldfish crackers and hubby loves cheezits.,i
In my quest to more healthy eating I found these and they really are a good alternative to both.,i
They have the small fun shape that appeals to the kids but they taste more like a cheezit only with all natural ingredients.,e
I signed up for subscribe and save every two months and I may have to change it to every month.,e
We got the first shipment less than a week ago and we already opened the second box.,e
i love the pastry.,i
i love the filling.,i
i love my pop tarts.,i
they are packaged very well and i had very little damage.,e
any damage i think would be from shipping.,e
the two tarts are packaged in an aluminum foil like material for freshness.,e
i just pop mine in the toaster for a couple minutes.,e
i really like the crust alot.,i
i am reordering because i like them so much and the price is really good.,e
always watch for a sale price or special on them.update:  now i toast them in my rosewill convection oven until they are crispy light brown on the outside and i see a tiny bubble come out of the little holes on top.,e
it only takes a few minutes.,e
they are very very delicious piping hot and crispy on the outside like a pastry crust.,i
i always watch for the best price here on amazon.com and this is the best place for me to buy them.,e
i keep pop tarts around for 34;emergencies34; and i was sorta nervous about buying in bulk but these are the freshest pop tarts i have ever bought including from supermarkets kudos to the sellers and well worth the purchase: i never knew they could be noncardboardlike before toasting,e
even better with some Skippy peanut butter  chocolate graham and marshmallow goodness2.50 per box when ordered 12 boxes of 12 for 30 with free s/h.,i
That equals .20 cents per pop tart can't beat that PLUS they taste Delicious the ones i ordered have a 'best used by' date of June 2013 so i've got 10 months,e
Chocolate lovers delight This is probably my favorite pop tart flavor.,i
It is best toasted because it will be all warm and toasty.,i
Eat with milk It reminds me of a chocolate candy bar.,i
Or better yet smores,i
My daughters love pop tarts.,i
This kind is their favorite kind.,i
I haven't eaten a pop tart since I was in elementary school and this flavor wasn't around when I growing up.,i
But my daughters rave about this particular one and how great it taste.,i
The original flavor would work fine with any dip and are okay on their ownThe salt and pepper flavor is AWESOME.,i
Really tasty and a great snack for only 100 caloriesThe sour cream and onion is a little chemically but decent.The barbeque is good but not tasty enough.,i
The flavor doesn't go as well with the texture.Haven't yet tried the other two flavors.,i
Will update as I do.If you haven't tried popchips they are sort of a cross between pringles and rice cakes.,i
Less like styrofoam than rice cakes and made with the same potato flakes kind of texture as pringles without as much fat.So far I have this on subscribe and save and will keep that subscription active.,e
These definitely beat a 150  300 calorie bag of potato chips as a snack.,i
The kids like these fruitandcream oatmeal better than the regular type.,i
This is still way better for them than dry sugar cereal like frosted flakes.,i
4 boxes for 10 is a decent price and it is nice to get several different flavors in one box so you get some variety for breakfast.,e
I like McCanns a little better than Quaker but McCanns fruitandcream is hard to find.,e
These small individually packaged pringle cups are perfect for lunch boxes.,e
And the bulk size is great for larger families.,e
For a family of 7 schoolaged kids this lasts a week.,e
Not too shabby on the pocket book.,e
There are just a few problems that we personally had with this collection:All of the pringles came broken.,e
Not one package had actual sized chips.,e
My creative kiddos ate them with a spoon.,e
Geniuses haha.,e
But in all reality I was fairly disappointed that they had all broken during transit.,e
I know that this has alot to do with the packaging of the box Amazon could have done a bit better.,e
But it's also at fault of the individual packages.,e
They leave a lot of space for the chips to get jostled around and broken where as full cans do not have that problem.The variety although delicious causes conflict with picky eaters.,e
Now I know I know I bought a variety what else did I expect?,e
But for a parent teacher camp counselor or babysitter of finicky kids do not I repeat do not get a variety.,e
Basically there are three flavors.,i
The cheese went first.,i
Then sour cream and onion.,i
And then plain.,i
Of course when one kid got the last sour cream and onion and another child was left with plain all heck broke loose Needless to say variety was a bad idea.,i
I will from now on be offering only one choice of flavor.With that being said.,i
I like that the pringles come individually packaged.,e
They're the perfect size for a lunch box picnic basket or cooler.,e
You can hand them out to each kid they all get the same sized serving and they all have their own little container.,e
Creates less of a hassle around one big pringles container.The chips were fresh They came in and tasted great.,e
The broken texture didn't make a big difference simply because they are so dang yummy we couldn't not eat themTruthfully in the future I think I'll opt out of the smaller packs simply because they came broken.,i
I'll also avoid variety.,e
Although variety is great for most people unfortunately I live in the world's most demanding household.,e
So no more variety for me.,e
But I would recommend it for someone single or who has extremely abnormally notpicky kids.,e
My kids loves pringles and have these variety pack make them feel happier.,e
Great snack for beautiful people.,e
i love mm..,i
I usually eat special k protein plus which I love but its nice to have another healthy cereal optionand this is it.,i
I love this cerealit tastes just like cinnamon toast crunch but this is healthy whole grain and not too sweet.it also has fiber and is only 110 cal per serving.,i
I bought two boxes of this cereal from Big Lots for 4 bucksgreat deal I highly recommend this cereal,e
My husband is the cereal eater in the family and he loves his cheerios mixed with corn flakes.,i
These healthy O's have great taste  flavor but didn't last long enough with my hungry husband.,e
We will be ordering them again.,e
I JUST GAVE A 5star review.,e
I USUALLY drink slimfast but found special k to be comparable to slimfast.,i
Amazon recomends special k for me but will not ship it to me.,e
I am prime and spend a lot with Amazon and fail to understand why they wil not send something I have purchased in the past and it now shows up as a recomendation for me.,e
I only think it's fair to let other people know that all four of these boxes of Kellogg's raisin bran state very clearly MADE in MEXICO.,e
I'm not making this up and I'm not trying to be mean but I'm sure some of us would prefer to have our food made in the USA.,e
This was not the first item I received food products in bulk that were made outside of our country including Thailand Mexico and China.,e
I have absolutely nothing against these countries politically or otherwise.,e
I just prefer to buy my food that's made in America.I hope this helps somebody and I called Amazon and they said quote  I will pass this information on and someone will get back to you.Actually I don't know what to do about this as I know the standards in other countries are not the same as our food standards in the United States.,e
At least we have the FDA to overlook products that are manufactured here in America.,e
The customer service representative I spoke to was shocked when I told her this was a Mexican made productand I don't mean packaged in MEXICO I mean MADE IN MEXICOI'd like to see some reply reviews to my review here.,e
I like Raisin bran when it was only one scoop.,e
The flakes in the raisin bran are crunchy and sweat there is no need to add more sugar there is just enough  the flakes stay crunchy for a while.The bran in the flakes helps me stay healthy.,i
I use low fat milk and it is low calorie breakfast.,i
These cups are great to take on the go.,i
I pack them in my lunch box with a bottle of milk.,e
The cup acts as a bowl and holds up very well.,e
No spills or leaks.,e
Also if you've never had raisin bran CRUNCH I highly recommend it.,e
Tastes awesome.,i
Gives popcorn a pleasing color and lets the corn pop fully.,i
I have been very satisfied.,e
I will purchase more of this.,e
I love the taste of this flavor and the texture is similar to a rice krispies snack bar.,i
I have tried many snack bars for diabetics and this one has the best taste and texture.,i
I don't use a whole bar for a single snack but it keeps well in a sealed baggie in my purse.,e
This is not a 34;slow carb34; bar such as Extend or Glucerna but it has a low glycemic index and does not raise my blood sugar when used as a between meal snack.,i
These are amazingly satisfying  The crackers are a bit tougher than cheezits slightly less salty and a little less flavorful... but when compared to the calorie content and the fullness factor these are really quite goodThe fiber content really helps the snack satisfy you more easily than cheezits and there's enough salt at the bottom of the bag to kill the remaining salt craving too :It's really been a diet saver to have these in my drawer at work  they take care of the afternoon munchies without killing me with calories and fat and they add nearly half of my fiber for the dayHighly recommended,i
After reading the reviews a couple of days ago I decided to order a box.,e
Like some other reviewers said they are a little dry.,i
Overall I think they are very good.,i
I'm a huge cheezit fan but I'll now be buying these instead.,i
Some might argue that just as there's no such thing as bad sex there's no such thing as bad chocolate.,i
Even the worst of the latter I've ever consumed  in Leningrad Russia in 1984  was still edible.,i
My history with the former we needn't discuss.So here we have NEWMAN'S OWN ORGANICS DARK CHOCOLATE NOODC.,i
Mind you it doesn't contain such poncy embellishments such as almonds macadamia nuts cherries pomegranate mint chips bacon shreds rice krispies orange peel caramel filling peanut butter raisins walnut pieces toffee crunch coconut red pepper coffee beans cranberries blueberries white chocolate chunks or the kitchen sink.,i
It's just 100 chocolate i.e.,i
evaporated cane juice chocolate liquor cocoa butter soy lecithin and vanilla  all organic of course.,i
It must be pointed out however that vanilla is used by chocolate makers to mask the flavor of imperfectly roasted cocoa beans.,i
Hmm.At 54 cocoa NOODC isn't particularly elevated on that scale.,i
Who in a chocolate company determines the what and why of an optimum concentration I wonder?,i
Probably the cocoa bean counters I imagine.Because I have a taste disorder described more fully in my review of the bookRemembering Smell: A Memoir of Losingand Discoveringthe Primal Sense I can't judge the sweetness of this candy but only the chocolate flavor and the mouth feel.,i
Both are pretty much average and acceptable.,e
Is it better than one of my favorite brands aCadbury Royal Dark Chocolate Bar 3.5 oz 24 countbar?,e
Uh ... no.,e
But it's infinitely better than that Commie chocolate eaten back in the nostalgic good old days of the Cold War I mean without any of the added embellishments mentioned above a plain chocolate bar has to work overtime to stand out from the rest of that genre on the shelf.Actually I was more interested in the subtleties of the label.,i
Paul himself is pictured with Nell his daughter by Joanne Woodward.,e
Nell started the Organics Division of Newman's Own in 1993 and remained at its head when it chippedoff the old block in 2001.,e
Dad still lent his support though before he died.,e
I gather it's Nells leadership and participation that's inferred in the confectionary's subtitle The Second Generation.Again according to the labeling the cocoa has been certified by the Rainforest Alliance.,e
Perhaps I'm being cynical but it makes me wonder how much Nell's company tips this outfit for the granting of its certification however legitimate such a ritual blessing may be.,e
Similarly there's the notation Certified Organic by Oregon Tilth  whatever a Tilth is.Also there's the usual CYA disclaimer: Manufactured on equipment that may process products containing peanuts other nuts milk powder wheat soy and egg.,e
The potential hazards for allergy sufferers aside how might those possible contaminants affect the organic quality of NOODC if they themselves aren't organic?,e
Inquiring minds want to know.,e
Perhaps the USDA Organic sticker carries implications here.,e
I'll certainly sleep better at night knowing the guv'mint is involved.And the fact that a 1 bar serving size contains only 5 mg of sodium means that my wife could chow down the whole thing  minus the single bite I was tossed  without fear of elevating her already borderlinehigh blood pressure.,e
After all dark chocolate is reportedly a health food.Would I buy NOODC on at the local chain supermarket without it being at a bargain club price?,e
Probably not.,e
I've never been convinced that organic isn't mostly a marketing ploy to raise the sticker and NOODC at full price doesn't give more satisfaction than a less expensive bar laden with assorted impurities toxins and carcinogens.,e
And both go down equally well with a glass of cold nonfat moo.,e
We set up our full sized Paragon popcorn maker for our New Years Eve party .,e
We had never tried the paragon popcorn and we enjoyed it very much.,e
This corn pops up really great and arrived very fresh good taste and we saved  money by purchasing this from Amazon.,e
Definitely will be buying this item again.,e
In the past I have always used Orville Redenbacher kernels when making popcorn at home.,e
I tried Paragon bulk bag yellow corn to see if it might be a lower cost substitute.,e
This Paragon corn pops up and tastes as well as the Redenbacher product at a fraction of the cost.,e
If you like to pop a lot of popcorn Paragon corn in bulk is definitely the way to go.,e
Try all of the coconut juice beverages out there and more and more they are becoming to taste like the milk that is left over from your bowl that had corn flakes in it.This is the best tasting to date.,i
Not artifically sweet tasting but actually quite good.,i
Slightly sweet naturally but not artifically with sugar.Get the type with pulp.Only negative I could say is that nearly every single can is dented.,i
Some are dented so badly that they are sqaure 4 sides are flat when they are supposed to be round like a coke can.,e
None were opened because of the damage but they were all dented.I am in the process of ordering more... Due the math.,e
Other vendors like the Zico brand give you less product some are 9 oz and others are 12 oz for 2.99 in the store for more money.,e
In other words with most brands you are getting less juice which tastes like corn flake milk which costs more.,e
With amy and brian you are getting more juice which tastes like young sweet coconuts with pulp FOR CHEAPER.,e
I know it sounds wierd but punch the numbers:Oops almost forgot to order another case,e
Very disappointed.,e
There is only 4 ounces to a box.,e
They are nothing more than minature pop tarts.,e
The crust is pasty the filling tastes totally artificial and they are grossly sweet.,i
They are only 100 calories because they are unbelievably small not because they are nutritional.,i
ICKY,i
I picked these up to try and instantly loved them.,e
Reminds me of a pop tart but crisper and without the cardboard taste.,i
The fruit is yummy and sweet and very satisfying.,i
I much prefer these toNewtons Fruit Crisps Snacks Mixed Berry 8Count Boxes Pack of 6because the fruit is much more delicious and not chewy like those are.,i
This flavor is also better than the blueberry.,i
They are also only 100 calories so great for a quick low cal snack.,i
These taste very good but the downside is they really are not satisfying.,i
These are great if you want something around that is sweet tastes lei liar to a pop tart  but doesn't have a lot of calories but it will not fill you up and keep you satisfied.,i
45 minutes later I am looking for something else.,e
i actually read the reviews never having seen these in a store and then took a risk buying them: they are fruity fresh tasting and a far far cry from cardboard pop tarts or fiber one tarts try them you might just like them :,i
Very light crispy with a small amount of filling.,i
Lighter than a pop tart very much more pastry taste.,i
2 small bars per package very good,e
These remind me of tiny pop tarts  Special K pastry crisps are a hit at my household.,i
Will be buying again,e
On line friends got me hooked on air popped corn so I keep it around the house in bulk amounts.,i
I'm a fan of Arrowhead Mills Organics so this purchase was a natural.,i
Very happy with purchase...the corn pops almost all the kernels.,e
Pumpkin is my favorite.,i
I spend all year waiting for September to role around so that Pumpkin flavored everything comes out then I bulk buy after 1 taste test purchase.I bought these hoping they would be amazing breakfast treats for months.,i
If good I would have laid in that kind of supply.,e
I work a part time job own a business and am an author I don't have time to cook breakfast so pop tarts are a must.I was so upset when I tasted it raw and cooked it was nasty.,i
This didn't taste like pumpkin let alone pumpkin pie and I spent so long in the Walmart back room waiting to stock and purchase it too,i
These are so great and yummy.,i
I love pumpkin so much.,i
I rated this a 4 because the pop tart boxes were heavily damaged.,e
No redblooded American would ever turn down a strawberry Pop Tart.,e
Especially the ones with the frosting on top.,i
Certainly these are created by the gods for our pleasure.,i
One of the finest and longestlasting shelf life food items you can have on hand.,e
Good for the beach or your bomb shelter  Yes wherever you take your pop tarts for as long as you take them there they'll be worth eating.,e
Originally designed to be toasted and eaten warm with today's toasters being toaster OVENS these no longer cook up correctly  Instead most people eat these raw including me  Sugar coating side down so it hits your tongue first this artificially flavored and manufactured quasifood product is legendary.,i
Look no further  you've found nirvana  Get some today eat them tomorrow or 5 years from now.,i
Same difference.,e
My pop tarts arrived fresh.,e
They tasted good.,i
I don't know about nutritional value but these were quick last minute breakfast options for me.,i
I'd never serve them to a child for breakfast simply because they are ladden in sugar and i prefer to give them something more substantial to start the day.,i
But beyond that the pop tarts are the same as they've always been.,i
I love this pop tart and chocolate fudge  and brown sugar  are my best favorites .,i
that is all I eat  and maybe some others,i
I was pleasantly surprised when I received my order.,e
Honestly I thought maybe I'd get something that wasstale or very old when ordering online.,e
However the price at the time was a good deal so I tried it anyway.I also received the type of pop tarts that you could sell retail on a counter somewhere.Rather than the ones in a thin silver foillike packaging these come with a thick printed plasticpackaging.The pop tarts themselves are a little bit thicker than the ones you get off the store shelves in theboxes of 8 or 12.,e
I love that because the crust part is really the only part I like.,i
This flavor isgood because it isn't as sickeningly sweet despite being brown sugar as some of the jellylike flavors.All in all I received a fresh product that was very tasty.,i
I'll be happy to order them again assales pop up.Update Nov 9 2011:Well I placed a second order.This one was not nearly as fresh and contained one box less than the last order.So be sure to read the listing carefully to see how many you are getting.,e
I thought I hadnotice of a sale but it was really a count decrease.This batch came with a couple of the boxes' perforations already popped not clear openand nothing was as fresh as the previous order.,e
Not sure why but I didn't like thequality swings of this item.,e
I'm dinging a star for lack of consistently fresh product.,e
Love pop tarts and the brown sugar cinnamon is the best Other complained that these arrived in pieces but mine were just fine and delicious.,i
My family loves brown sugar cinnamon pop tarts and these didn't disappoint.,i
They arrived in perfect condition and the pop tarts themselves are wrapped nicely; better than the usual thin wrapper used for grocery store purchases.,e
Fresh product.,e
Great size.,e
However this time we had a lot of packets that had a significant number of broken chips.,e
Yes we could have complained to the cheezit factory but considering the cost it wasn't worth our effort.,e
Kellogg's Corn Flakes are a great cereal as well as an item I use for cooking and baking.,i
Since young my Mom would take peanut butter and chocolate and melt them over a double boiler and then after the mixture was melted would take it off the stove and stir in the corn flakes softly so as not to crush them much.,i
Then she would put wax paper on a cookie sheet and drop the mixture by spoonful onto the wax paper.,i
Then put them in the refrigerator until the set up.,i
They taste so good that way.,i
She would also make a couple of different casseroles as well as a sandwich spread out of Corn Flakes so though some don't like that they are Frosted Flakes they are great for other things as well,i
GREAT DEAL here at Amazon  The corn flakes are high quality and are a GREAT MIXER with the more expensive cereals so ya don't go broke stayin' healthy,e
I ordered these as they are in a larger box than the shrinking corn flakes in my local super market.,e
My local supermarket has 14 ounce boxes these are 18 ounce and the cost is about the same.,e
I don't mind waiting a day or two for corn flakes if it saves money.,e
The expiration was about a year from the delivery date and is about the same as my local market.,e
As long as Amazon ships the same product for less per ounce and I can afford it I'll buy online.,e
OK these are just cornflakes I know; but when you want corn flakes you really want 'Kellogg's corn flakes.,e
My wife isn't a fan of corn flakes and just doesn't believe that these can be any different from store brand corn flakes.,e
Kellogg's does not make corn flakes for anyone else so if you want the Kellogg's taste you have to buy these period.,i
Same great taste as always.,i
A few days ago I stumbled across this outstanding cereal while browsing our local grocery chain's web site for healthy local foods.,i
Its has far fewer calories than the raisin bran I normally eat when I do cereal and is even lower calorie and higher in fiber than the Shredded Wheat my wife eats.,i
It also has 45 of your daily iron and nice percentages in the 25 to 35 range of other necessary vitamins.It also has a very good taste you could eat a few pieces of it at a time for a snack.,i
A 3/4 cup serving has 7 grams of sugar.,i
Since it is still lower calorie than what I've been eating that doesn't concern me.With 1/3rd cup of milk and a half of a banana breakfast is less than 200 calories and very nutritious.,i
I use a bit less milk than many on cereal.,i
I don't like it to ever get soggy yet I don't like it completely dry.,i
I have developed the knack of pouring just enough so that the milk doesn't show in the cereal.,i
If I can see the milk after I pour cereal already in the bowl LOL I know I've overdone it for my taste.If you are watching calories beware of the other flavor varieties of this cereal line.,i
They are almost twice the calories per serving 200 or so compared to the 110 for this.I do find that 3/4 cup of this cereal with a half banana is just as filling for me as a cup of Raisin Bran with a half banana so I'm getting more nutrition more fiber and about 80 fewer calories for a bowl of cereal.,i
I have always had trouble getting enough fiber in my diet so the extra provided here is very helpful.The Amazon price is considerably less than our local supermarket which has this at about 4 a box.,i
I got my order on time and it was exactly as described.,e
The cheezits were fresh and we thoroughly enjoyed them.,e
Definitely ordering again....I now have them as part of my subscribe and save,e
I really like cheezit so with the individual packages I can control my consumption.,e
Recommend it for a quick controlled snack.,e
So many cheezits HIhgly suggest if you are hunting for a deal.,e
The individual packages stay fresh,e
Obviously you know if you like cheezits or you don't.,e
I love them.,e
I did buy cheezit's in a different packaging and when they arrived the crackers for some reason were nothing but crumbs.,e
Therefore I did not like them.,e
THESE were not crummy haha in any way.,i
Nice whole crackers the same cheesy taste we have all known and loved.I also appreciate the size of the packages.,i
Although some of this packaging is geared toward children I found this helpful in my quest for weight loss.,e
Instead of sitting down in front of the TV with a whole box of cheezits I sat down with a little package.,e
It is also handy to take along if I'm held  up to long at a doctor's appointment etc.,e
Great deal if your a cracker lover and like cheez its.,e
And save money over walmart and the bags are larger.,e
great its what I expect from cheez it,e
this box of cheez its is a great buy it comes in there snack mix box they are fresh and great to eat,e
I brought this product when it was listed at around 78 here on Amazon.,e
At that price I considered my order to be excellent value for money.,e
I notice the price has gone up since then and is currently being sold for just over 20.,e
I would not consider this price acceptable  the product tastes nice but it's not THAT great.I will review and rate this product based on my feelings having paid the lower price.,e
At first I enjoyed these snacks a lot  the combination of different snacks in a single box tasted good and I found them rather addictive.,i
However I soon began to find that two of the particular snacks included were a bit too similar for my liking  there are two pretzellike snacks they taste almost identical and I'm not really a huge fan of pretzels.,e
Also I didn't really care much for the wheat square snacks they didn't have much taste and there were too many of them which left me with the rice balls which were nice but there were hardly any of them in a box the 34;bread bits34; which were a bit too hard and crunchy for my liking and the cheezits which I always love.,i
Who doesn't like pop tarts?,e
I bought a box of these since they were at such a great deal and I have to say I've had enough for quiet awhile I could buy maybe 24 pop tarts for the price I bought this 48count box for on Amazon so it is a great deal However the downside is that almost every pack was crumbled and the pop tarts weren't whole I'm assuming during shipping and UPS not knowing what's inside the box they just throw them in the truck.,e
I will be donating the unopened boxes I have left to a local homeless shelter as I figure they could be happy to have a broken crumbled pop tart than no food at all.,e
Great price for my kids two favorite kinds of pop tarts.,e
Have compared prices between here and the stores and you cant beat the price you get with subscribe and save.,e
I purchased this set of pop tarts so the kids could have something to eat on the way to school.,e
The bus coms so early and the kids aren't ready to eat that early.,e
So I needed something they could take with them.,e
I like that it was more than one flavor and they were fresh.,i
Kids enjoyed them.,i
I loved the fact that I wasn't running out to store to purchase more.,e
This is a must have if you have kids who don't/won't eat  before leaving for school and become hungry before lunch.,e
In the past I have absolutely hated pop tarts.,e
I just couldn't imagine why someone would actually eat them.,e
However my girlfriend loves them and things were running a bit tight on the grocery expenses front.,e
I certainly wasn't in a position to start buying Ben and Jerry's.,e
These took the place of such expensive gourmet treats.,e
I figured that 8.53 for 48 of these thingys made it a cheap way to stretch our dollars for a week.I think the Amazon description said assorted flavors.,e
We received strawberry and brown cinnamon.,i
Maybe different shipments have different flavors but I wasn't going to argue given heir low cost.,e
We received four boxes.,e
Each box has six foil packets.,e
Each packet has two tarts.OK OK I actually dug into these before my girlfriend.,e
Properly toasted they're pretty decent.,i
The pastry shell I guess I can call it that was not overally doughy or pasty.,i
The filling tasted the way the box said.,i
A single pack of two is reasonably filling as a dessert.Kids and pop tart afionados would probably give these five stars.,e
Given the fact hat I really had expected a onestar treat I think the four I'm giving this is pretty good.,i
Thank you for bundling two of our most favorite flavors together and selling it at a very affordable price Unlike another reviewer I did not have any issues with pop tarts damaged during shipping  everything arrived in perfect shape and in 2 days with Prime.,e
The expiration date is almost a year away the poptarts are fresh and delicious.,e
Could not be happier with my purchase.,e
Anything make by Kellogs is a good thing and I just love the rice krispies treats I only wish they were all just regular,e
didn't really care for these sorta tasteless and not waht i expected it to be cause I like rice krispies to me not worth the calories,i
This is a strange cereal.,e
My daughter described it as rice crispies corn flakes and peanut butter panda puffs all thrown together.,e
It tastes pretty good.,i
My main complaint is that this is not a hearty cereal.,i
It has decent nutrition but I prefer a cereal that will keep me full a while.,i
It makes a great snack but for me not a daily food.,i
Despite the picture on the box I was still surprised to pour this cereal into a bowl and find that it looked like an odd mashup of Kix rice crispies and corn flakes.,e
From all appearances the company seems to be exactly the kind of socially responsible business we like to support.,e
They recycle track their environmental impact produce a strictly glutenfree product and use organic nonGMO everything.I was very pleased and expect to get this again.,i
The mail lady delivered my sample box of this cereal just as we were finishing lunch so my husband and I both had some for dessert.Some reviewers have commented on a burnt flavour: I think they're tasting the buckwheat.,e
Buckwheat is not my favourite grain and it was really rather potent as I started eating the bowl but seemed to wear off as I got close to done eating.,i
My husband noticed that the coating on the cereal wore off and left his water all flavourful that he poured on his I had mine with soy milk.,i
The cereal didn't have much taste outside of the sweet coating; I did not find that it was too sweet too start with.,i
I couldn't taste any vanilla at all.,i
My husband thought the sodium content was a bit excessive 130mg per serving.I do think it's a bit overpriced for what you get and the fact that it's really not that impressive of a taste.,i
I really like the Mesa Sunrise corn flakes and was expecting something a little more akin to that so in that regard I was disappointed.,i
Still this wasn't horrible cereal.,i
I wouldn't go out and buy it but I would eat it again were it to be at someone's house because with all the grains it's still a better option than most highly refined commercial cereals.,i
The first thing that came to mind when I opened this box is that the cereal looked like a mixture of Kix rice crisps and corn flakes.,e
Unlike those serials Nature's Path Crunchy Vanilla Sunrise is very tasty.,i
The sweetness with hints of vanilla is yummy.,i
Plus unlike most crunchy cereals this one is nut free but made in a factory where nuts are used.. an added bonus for those who can't have nuts.My only gripe about this cereal is that it is very sweet... almost too sweet.,i
The main ingredients are corn and sugar.,i
At 7g of sugar per 2/3 cup I find it too sugary for a healthy cereal.,i
Because of the sugar content I will probably pass in the future as I prefer Annie's Cinna Bunnies if I need a sugary treat.,i
Nature's Path new breakfast product Crunchy Vanilla Sunrise is a good tasting cereal that is gluten free.,i
It tastes lightly sweetened a combination of corn flakes crispy rice and crunchy puffed corn.,i
The crunchy and chewy texture is maintained in milk for several minutes even though the food is gluten free.,i
The cereal is sweetened with cane juice and molasses.,i
The ingredients include: corn rice flax quinoa buchwheat and amaranth.,i
There is 1g of fat no saturated fat 25g of carbs and 2g of protein per serving of 2/3 cup.,i
There is an important warning that the cereal is produced in a facility that uses peanuts tree nuts and soy.Like many organic cereal products today the price point is substantial for the 10.6 oz box.,i
I ate the cereal with side dishes of Greek yogurt blueberries and boysenberries and walnuts.,i
The cereal's flavor held its own against these other foods and I will buy it in the future.,i
With the typical Kellogg's or Post cereal the choice mostly depends on taste.,i
With Nature's Path cereal other considerations come into play.,i
This cereal is produced using no synthetic pesticides or herbicides using no irradiation contains no artificial preservatives or additives and no genetically engineered seeds or ingredients.,i
It was produced on farms that use enriched drought resistant soil produce less soil erosion less groundwater pollution and practice improved farm biodiversity.,i
If supporting products of this type matters for you then you will probably be predisposed to buy this cereal.,e
Still though in the end it has to taste good if you are going to continue buying it.,i
I think it does taste very good.,i
The best way to describe the taste is as being like rice krispies but with a strong vanilla flavor.So if the price seems reasonable and you want to support this type of product you won't find yourself sacrificing taste.,i
I opened this gluten free cereal expecting a variation on granola.,i
Way too sweet and light to boot more corn puffs and rice krispies meets a splash of flaxseeds.,i
If I were to take this in the morning I'd go into insulin overdrive even with milk to slow it down.,i
But I'd be crashing by mid morning and overeating at noon both dangerous activities for glutenfree people in a nonglutenfree world.2/3 cup is counted as a serving although you will probably eat a full cup like most cereals since it is light boosting the calories from 110 to 165.,i
Actually most will probably go over a cup.,e
The fiber content of 3g per 2/3 cup is okay but you'd do better with a green smoothie made with whole fruit nuts and veggies.,i
There are 7g of sugar 11.5 if you take a cup organic evaporated cane juice and molasses are just as bad as high fructose corn syrup in terms of raising your blood sugar and blood insulin levels except it won't have pesticide residues and you might pick up a hint of a mineral or two from the molasses.,i
It has 25g of carbs 37.5 per cup which will quickly convert to sugar.Don't get me wrong the stuff is tasty.,i
I tasted it then blew my diet with a large bowl of it.,i
Note to self: don't review Amazon food products on an empty stomach.,i
The corn puffs won't be GMO and the grains are organic.,i
But use it as a dessert.,e
It isn't good for you unless you are using it to replace Cocoa Puffs.,i
If you want a good breakfast that will sustain you until lunch and avoids gluten fry a couple of eggs sunny side up in coconut oil and serve over greens or tomato and nori.,i
Your blood sugar will thank you.,i
Save this for a treat to deter you from your roommate's conventional cookies when your willpower is weak.,e
Unlike the Quaker Oat squares I recently reviewed q.v.,i
thanks Vine for giving me breakfast stuff when Nature's Path says vanilla they MEAN vanilla.,i
Bold brash and almost creamy if you can imagine that in a puffedgrain cereal I can't either but it's the only way I can think of to describe the forwardness of the vanilla here.,i
But then there's that puffedgrain cereal thing.,i
You get to thinking that a puffed grain is a puffed grain whether it's rice or quinoa.,i
Lemme tell you something bub: that ain't true.,i
While the texture here is consistent despite the variety of grains this has a lighter forgive me for using this phrase which I despise but I can't think of another that makes sense mouth feel than your good old fashioned rice krispies or whatever.amusing note: Chrome's spellcheckerroronarealword of the day: quinoa.I powered through this box in two days despite knowing that I wouldn't be having it again for a while save these last Vine reviews of breakfast stuff I'm going lowcarb for a spell.,i
Been mulling it over ever since and I can't think of a bettertasting cereal I've ever had.,i
But to be on the safe side since I don't remember all the kinds of sickeninglysweet cereal I ate as a kid as a yardstick when I was growing up we still had sugar smacks sugar corn pops and all the other cereals that compared to today were paragons of truth in advertising I'll say this one's definitely in the top five.,i
Were I not going lowcarb I would be perfectly content to eat this stuff for breakfast every day for the rest of my life.,e
It's THAT good.,i
This cereal looks like someone mixed together kix rice crispies and corn flakes.,e
It tastes like they did that then added sugar and some vanilla.,i
I found it to be both very sweet the second ingredient is sugar and not very filling.,i
It turned to mush within about five minutes too so unless you're a powereater it'll be soggy goop by the end of the bowl.I know that 'contents may settle' but the bag inside the box was only half full which seemed a bit laughable.,i
Based on what i poured in my cereal bowl which i admit is far larger than the 'serving size' of 2/3 of a cup each box contains about four breakfasts.,e
If however you only eat 2/3 of a cup of cereal each morning the box will last you much longer.,e
The ridiculously small serving size also explains why a cereal that tastes like it's mostly sugar only has 7 grams of sugar per serving.There are precious few glutenfree cereals on shelves but there has to be at least one that's better than this.,i
These are pumpkin pie in pop tart form.,i
You need to buy these.,e
I love them.,i
I wish I had more of them.,e
One of the things I look forward to during the Holiday Season is Pumpkin Pop Tarts: I love them and the only place I have ever seen them is on Amazon.,e
So every year I wait for my Amazon Fix of Pumpkin Pop Tarts.I admit to being a Poptart junkie with my all time year long favorite being FROSTED BROWN SUGAR CINNAMON poptarts.PopTarts Frosted Brown Sugar Cinnamon 16Count Tarts Pack of 8But OH how I await the PUMPKIN PIE pop tarts.,e
That soft  velvety pumkin taste and feel is mixed right in to these pastries and for about six weeks at holiday time I immerse myself in the sweet gooey pumpkiney flavor.,i
These Tarts are SO FRESH.,i
No cooking necessary BUT oh the wonderful smells and tastes if you doIt is a snack made in Heaven for us to use as one of the seven deadlies and eat to our heart's content.,i
Buy them when they first arrive on line and they are still so fresh the pumpkin filling drips from between the two pastries.,e
The colorful topping lends to the visual and gustatory thrill.Do indeed splurge and get some of these for yourself.,i
But do not get too many; be sure to leave some for meI tried another Seasonal Poptart product this Year: The Gingerbread PopTarts.,i
Although they were also nice and fresh I did not care for them at all.,e
To me they did not taste like Gingerbread a bitKellogg's PopTarts Printed Fun  Gingerbread Limited Edition  12 Pastries 21.1oz.,i
BoxSo I suggest you stick with Pumpkin Pie and you too may have a new Tradition for the Holidays,i
kellogg's Crunchy Nut is basically corn flakes coated with sugar and microscopically sized nut pieces.,i
I can't even taste the nuts on them.My key comments:1  These are completely void nutritionally2  Seems like this should have been another version of Corn Flakes instead of an altogether new cereal.3  As I alluded to above they don't even taste particularly good.Overall a lousy product in my opinion.,i
To set the stage  I like cereal.,i
A lot.,i
:  I tend to eat healthy cereals for breakfast but I also like to get my sweet on from time to time.,i
I put these corn flakes squarely into the sugar cereal category but you can judge the nutritional facts listed below for yourself.,i
They're very low in fat and not too high in calories.,i
I've eaten a bowl at each of the past five meals sometimes for dessert.,e
Seriously these aren't a bad choice for a relatively low calorie and low fat dessert.Taste:To quote Adam Richman of Man v. Food Oh my goodness.,i
Ooooh my goodness.,i
To help explain from the moment that I opened the box and smelled the cereal and through the first five bowls I kept trying to figure out which candy these reminded me of.,i
Yes candy.,i
That was the first thing that popped into my head and it never left.,e
I think that I figured it out  Kathryn Beich Golden Crumbles a fund raising candy during my childhood days in Illinois with peanut butter coated in a candy shell.,i
Those were probably my favorite candy growing up so it's no surprise that I like this cereal.As the name suggests these taste like honey and nuts.,i
They are very sweet IMO but in a good way.,i
Oh such a good way.Texture:With the sugar coating these corn flakes have a nice crunch to them and stay crunchy for longer in milk than regular corn flakes.,i
At the time of this review the ingredients are listed on Amazon but the nutritional facts aren't.,e
So I'll put them here and let you decide for yourself if it's what you want for breakfast or whenever.,e
I like that they are low in fat and relatively low in calories and I'm not bothered by the sugar level.,i
I wish that they didn't have high fructose corn syrup but dang  did I mention that they're delicious?,i
:Facts for dry cereal no milk:  Serving size = 3/4 cup calories = 120 total fat = 1g no saturated or trans fat cholesterol = 0mg sodium = 160mg potassium = 40mg total carbs = 26g dietary fiber lt; 1g sugars = 11g protein = 2gBottom Line:If you like sugar cereals honey and nuts  then I highly recommend giving these a try if you can find them for about 33.50 a box or less.,i
5/box the price that Amazon had last week is a bit steep IMO.,e
Crunchy Nut is really good.,i
I was dubious at first because there are a ton of honey and nut flavored cereals out there and I didn't see how a new one would stand out.,e
Crunchy Nut stands apart because it is VERY nutty tasting.,i
The predominate flavor here is actually peanuts then honey coated corn flakes.,i
I loved it but it just isn't that good for you hence the 4 stars.,i
Crunchy nut definitely falls into the sugarycereal category but it tastes so good that one box lasted only a couple days.,i
Exactly like good oldfashioned corn flakes with regards to crunch and lightness with the added flavor of honey and crumbled peanuts.,i
I'm not a fan of these with milk as I don't like soggy cereal.,i
Instead I sprinkle them on yogurt cottage cheese or ice cream.,i
They don't end up mushy and they add great crunch and nutty flavor to my plain boring snack.,i
They are ok. We me and the family were not as wild about them as we thought we might be at first.,e
They definitely are crunchy I will give them that.Perhaps it's because they are basically just corn flakes with a new twist on the taste.,i
They do a nice job of distributing the nuts throughout.,e
They are able to get the peanuts into each bite because they seem to stick to the corn flakes which makes sense.,i
If it was any other way they would just sink to the bottom of the box.I prefer the taste of the frosted corn flakes a bit more over the honey.,i
I guess it's just a different kind of sweetness.,i
But I believe that for those who's favorite cereals are ones with honey flavors in them they should try this out since I think they would be perfect for them,i
Crunchy sweet flakes cereal.,i
Though a bit too sweet ala sugar frosted flakes.,i
The texture is good and holds in milk.,i
My kids really enjoy this cereal probably because it so sweet.,i
If you have had Nut  Honey Crunch it tastes very similar.The image on the box shows each piece coated in nut flakes far from accurate ,e
Perhaps over salmon chicken sweet potato casserole etc.,i
This new cereal tastes very good although they are a bit on the sweet side for me.,i
They don't have much of a peanut taste which is fine with me.,i
There strongest point is that they start crunchy and stay that way in milk.,i
I really hate mushy cereal and these last a long time in milk.,i
They have a honey taste that is very pleasing.,i
I find them a good snack dry also.For adults like me they may be a bit too sweet but for kids they are probably about right.,i
I'm not a nutritionist but I suspect that they are more nutritional than frosted flakes and taste much better.,i
Give them a try especially if your into sweet cereals.,i
This cereal has a nutty flavor to it and it would be good if it weren't for the over abundance of sugar in this.,i
This is just corn flakes with a sprinkling of nuts and a thick coating of glazed sugar.,i
There isn't much fiber in it either so this is basically an unhealthy cereal.,i
The flakes stay crispy because of the thick coating of sugar takes a long time to wear off I won't be buying this cereal I like a little sugar with my cereal and NOT a little cereal with my sugar.,i
There are so many cereals on the market yet always something new.,e
When I opened the box my first thought was these smell like Kellogs Corn Pops very sweet smelling.,i
As for taste not really a whole lot of it its almost like the milk overpowered the taste.,i
Its kind of somewhere between corn flakes and frosted flakes like the cereal can't make up its mind to cater to adults or kids.I didn't find them to be particularly crunchy but really don't care too much about that.,i
The nuts in every bite are so small and I guess are in the flakes if that's what the different color pieces are didn't see a real nut.,i
Flakes are shiny with sugar.,i
I have nothing against sugar and actually have Reese's Puffs sometimes its just these are marketed as crunchy nut and they aren't really either crunchy or have nuts.,i
Not as fullfilling as other cereals like Raisin Bran or Special K you'll need a banana in it.Some pros:  fairly low in calories again taste is subjective so what's to say.,i
Some fibre.I wish I could write more but the cereal just doesn't give me any reason to.,i
This looks to be a relaunch of the old and internationally widely available Honey Nut Corn Flakes.The name alone should tell you most of what you need to know about this cereal as it aptly describes exactly how this cereal tastes.,e
Corn Flakes that are sweet with honey and sprinkled with peanuts for a slightly nutty flavor.,i
I would say this cereal tastes sweeter than most and definitely sweeter than standard corn flakes  but is still not as sweet as the traditional Kellogs kids cereals e.g.,i
Frosted Flakes Fruit Loops etc.A high quality cereal and recommended for those that would enjoy this flavor combination.,i
Kellogg's Crunchy Nut cereal consists of corn flakes covered in honey and bits of peanuts.,i
It is somewhat crunchy although not any more so than most other cereals.,i
Compared to a lot of other breakfast cereals it doesn't have large amounts of vitamins or minerals but it does have 25 of the daily recommended values of vitamins B6 and B12 as well as iron.,i
There are also small amounts of fiber and protein.The key characteristic of this cereal is that it is almost overwhelmingly sweet with sugar making up more than 35 of each serving by weight.,i
The second ingredient listed on the box is sugar and is also contains molasses honey and high fructose corn syrup.,i
It is so sweet that I could only just make out the tastes of honey and peanuts.,i
There is no way that I could ever eat this for breakfast but it does make a nice dessert in very small amounts.,e
If you're looking for a very sweet sugary cereal this might be a good choice for you but I probably won't be buying it again.,i
Our family liked Kellogg's crunchy nut cereal very much for that extra crunchy feeling with a coating of nuts on the top and it was not too sweet.,i
It was tasty like the other kellogg's brand cereals even more crunchy than their own cereals.,i
Kids can eat as a morning cereal or as a snack even.,e
I wish they had mixed some other nuts other flavors or dried nuts to even taste more good.,i
I think anyone would like this cereal.,e
Its worth trying once and see if you like it too.,e
Doing a food item is always difficult individual taste and preference being a major reason why we like or dislike something.,i
Breakfast cereal might be one of the more difficult items.,e
Having written disclaimers here is my review.This is a heavily sweetened item with 120 calories in  of a cup.,i
In addition there are peanut chips stuck to the flakes.,i
Honey and molasses are the major sweeteners.,i
The result is a corn flake with peanut slivers and honey that has a sweet pleasant taste.,i
The flakes hold up well in milk or can be eaten dry as a snack.,i
I think this would make an excellent base for a sweet trail mix snack.,i
My twoyear old grandson likes them dry in his dish as a snack.This might be an alternate to the heavily sugar sweeten cereals but is not a good choice for anyone looking to control their weight.,i
This cereal is some kind of awesome.,e
I usually eat Honey Bunches of Oats with Almonds and this is every bit as good and maybe a little better.It's basically corn flakes coated in honey with chopped nuts.,i
Doesn't sound thrilling but it has a great flavor.It stays crispy in milk only for a few minutes before getting a little soggy but I prefer a softer cereal anyway.,i
The thing that really stands out for me is the honey taste even more so than the nut taste.,i
It still is a great combination though.,i
I think they really hit a home run with this cereal and I'll probably buy more.This can also be eaten dry as a snack it tastes good on it's own with no milk too.,i
I think I may have found a new favorite cereal  At 120 calories per serving it fits into my diet as well.,i
Love the new Crunchy Nut cereal.,i
Tastes like honey drizzeled over corn flakes and nuts.,i
Not much more to say.,e
If you like those 3 things you will love this,i
As cereals go they are not the surgeryest but they are a very sweet cereal.,i
The closest other cereal I thought this tasted like was frosted flakes.,i
They are kind of like frosted flakes with a nuttiness to them.,i
The cereal overall is good but I wouldn't go out of my way to find it for sure.,i
It is kinda weird writing reviews about food products because well most people have different tastes.That being said I tore open the box poured a bowl and enjoyed what I tasted.,i
If your a frosted flakes fantry these out to see if they are comparable.,i
They stayed crispy in the milk and had a nice crunch to them.,i
If you like peanut flavor with your sweetened corn flakes you will probably like this cereal.,i
They are sweet too sweet for me but not overly sugared; a 31 g serving has 11 g of sugar.,i
There are more sugary cereals on the market than this one.,i
This cereal contains High Fructose Corn Syrup sugar molasses  honey.,i
A smorgasbord of sweetenersThe peanuts bits are very small of course  I wouldn't expect whole peanuts if they're going to be stuck to the flakes.,i
They do add a nice peanut flavor  texture.It stays crisp just slightly longer than regular corn flakes.,i
I actually like that they become soggy because I prefer soggy cereal...I know it's weird.I would only buy this cereal to top off my unsweetened shredded wheat  it adds a little interest to a plain bowl of cereal but it's too much sugar for my taste to eat a whole serving of this cereal alone.,i
But if you like a sweeter cereal  peanuts you will probably like this just fine.,i
Sure I love the taste of the sugary sweetness of this cereal.,i
Tastes like frosted flakes with honey and nut mixed in.,i
Unfortunately with no ok less than 1 gram fiber they don't provide the nutrition that I need.,i
The nutritional panel is basically carbs... 11 of 26 which are sugar.,i
I kept eating but I never felt full but I sure did get a ton of empty calories.,i
I can't recommend this to anyone looking to eat a hearty breakfast.,i
If you are looking for corn sugar peanuts and honey first four ingredients and don't care about nutrition this cereal is for you.,i
For everyone else look elsewhere.Full Ingredients: look at all the sugarMilled Corn Sugar Peanuts Honey Malt Flavoring Molasses Salt High Fructose Corn Syrup Caramel Color Iron Annatto Extract Color Niacinamide Ascorbic Acid Vitamin C Sodium Ascorbate Vitamin C Pyridoxine Hydrochloride Vitamin B6 Thiamin Hydrochloride Vitamin B1 Riboflavin Vitamin B2 Vitamin A Palmitate Vitamin B12 Folic Acid Bht Preservative Vitamin D Wheat Starch.,i
Nice and crunchy and very deliciousThe flavor is enjoyable similar to corn flakes but just a little nuttier and sweeter.It also does a good job of keeping you full until lunch time.,i
Supposedly Crunchy Nut has been available in England for quite some time and Kellogg's finally decided to bring it over to US shores.,e
Kellogg's used to make Nut  Honey Crunch though it was discontinued a while ago.,e
Like Crunchy Nut they came in both flakes and Os versions.,e
I have fond memories of eating Nut  Honey Crunch in the 80s and missed it when it was discontinued.,e
Remember the Nothin' Honey commercials?,e
;Well if you want to relive those days give Crunchy Nut a try.,e
To the best of my taste buds' recollection the crunch and flavor are nearly identical.,e
There is the sweet tang of the honey coating and satisfying texture of the peanutsprinkled corn flakes.,i
The flavor is comparable to frosted flakes but with honey and nut flavors.,i
It holds up well in milk retaining it's crunch down to the last bite.,i
Comparing ingredients and nutritional information from their respective boxes shows that they match up pretty closely there as well though the serving size for NH; is 2/3 cup and for CN it is 3/4 cup.,i
If anything ounce for ounce Crunchy Nut Golden Honey Nut Flakes looks a little healthier for you than Nut  Honey Crunch.That's not to say it truly healthy though.,i
Sure it is fortified with the usual assortment of vitamins and when eaten with milk you fill even more of your daily nutritional requirements.,i
However it is still laden with sugar honeymolasses and High Fructose Corn Syrup.,i
My taste buds must have changed a bit since the 80s because it is almost too sweet for me.,i
Blame it on a steady diet of low sugar cereals over recent years.,i
I would have a hard time eating this regularly first thing in the morning.,i
Instead I mimic a habit of my father's and eat a small bowl of it in place of dessert.,i
You could even mix it with other cereals that contain less sugar as my dad would do.Don't get me wrong Crunch Nut tastes great on it's own and if you have a sugar/crunch craving it hits the spot.,i
It even makes a good breading base for fried chicken.,i
I just no longer have quite the sweet tooth I once did.,i
I give Crunchy Nut Golden Honey Nut Flakes fives stars for flavor mouthfeel and craving satisfaction.,i
One star comes off for health impact though.,i
If you decide to give it a try I would shop around a little.,e
Current 3rd party vendor prices are ludicrous.,e
A much better deal can probably be found at your local grocer.,e
Well I don't think there's much sense in going into much depth on this product  it's a corn flake cereal covered in honey and sprinkled with peanut pieces.,i
This is not a health cereal but instead a sweet cereal that is sure to please the younger palate.,i
I sat down with this cereal and my teenage son and we tore into the box.,e
He thought that it was quite good and plans on having more tomorrow.,i
As for me I thought it was good though I find myself drifting away from the sweet cereals.So if you are looking for a mueslilike cereal you will be disappointed with this cereal.,i
If on the other hand you are looking for a delicious sweet cereal to charge up your batteries in the morning then this might want to give this one a try.,i
I think you'll like it.,i
No mushy flakes here these keep their crunch to the bottom of the bowl.,i
They're  much more substantial tasting than corn flakes and with the addition of fruit I believe they make a healthy breakfast DESPITE the sugar they contain.,i
They contain 11g of sugar by the way which is less than some bran cereals with raisins.A side note: a few years ago I read a study that said kids and adults who use unsweetened cereals actually end up eating more sugar because they add so much of their own from the sugar bowl.Back to the taste: I didn't find anything particularly nutty tasting about the flakes.,i
I could see the small peanut flecks on each flake but the taste didn't come through.,i
Still that didn't detract from the product at all for me.Overall I enjoyed these very much and would recommend giving them a try.,e
I really enjoyed this cereal.,i
It tastes sort of like a combination of frosted flakes and honey nut cheerios.,i
You can definitely taste the honey and the nuts.,i
At 120 calories for 3/4 of a cup of cereal it's not a bad nutritional bargain either.,i
Good for both breakfast and a lowercal snack when your sweet tooth comes calling.,e
As cereals go there are plenty of choices.,e
I tend to favor plainer ones myself so the sweetness of the honey taste wasn't the plus for me it might be for someone else.,i
Still it was not bad.,i
The bits of peanut added an extra tang.,i
The overall effect reminded me of a cross between frosted flakes and Cracker Jacks.As an experiment I used up the rest of the box by turning it into an impromptu snack bar mix.,e
I melted some marshmallows with a bit of butter over low heat and stirred in the cereal.,i
One cup of marshmallows to every 2 cups of cereal.,e
I then took the mix and spread it onto a buttered baking sheet packing it together.,e
When cooled I sliced it up into handysized servings.,e
The result was tasty crunchy and a bit more portable.If I were to try the experiment again I might crunch the flakes down a bit more before mixing in the marshmallows and try adding things like chocolate chips butterscotch bits raisins craisins dried cranberry snacks or combinations of them all.,e
...these are REALLY good.,i
I love cold cereal okay I also love hot cereal and sometimes nothing hits the spot like a bowl of corn flakes.,e
I usually like the plain ones AP's house brand which I suspect is made by Nestleacute; is a favorite and add my own sugar but I couldn't resist trying Kellogg's Crunchy Nut flakes when they were offered and I'm glad I did.,i
They're sweet without being cloying somehow manage to stay crisp in the bowl maybe the glaze works like armor?,i
and the peanut presence crunch/flavor was a unique and tasty addition.,i
Granted this isn't going to appeal to the healthconscious crowd but for what it ismainstream cold cerealit's very satisfying and well worth sampling if you like cornflakes and peanuts.,i
And BTW it makes for nice snacking out of hand without the milk too.,e
I did not go for the taste of this cereal.,i
For me it was not so much as it being too sweet as it just not suiting me.,i
I am more of a raisin bran type cereal fan.,e
My kids were not wild about it either so it will never go into my cart again.,e
I was not overly jazzed by the ingredient list either which made me feel like it was not one of the best nutritional choices.,i
Do your body a favor and make another choice.,i
This is a delicious sweetened corn flake cereal very crispy.,i
The ground peanut granules are visible on the flakes.,i
However I could not taste any trace of peanut flavor or notice any courser texture due to the granules' presence.,i
That said it still tasted very good.,i
The four stars are due to the lack of nutperception when it is a prominent part of the name of the product.,i
This is a nice light flaked cereal that reminds me of frosted flakes but not as sweet.,i
I was hesitant about the honey in the cereal but there is just the right touch of honey in it.,i
The crunch hold up in milk for quite awhile I hate cereals that after a few minutes just wilt  I will continue to buy this cereal.,i
I'm not a huge fan ofKellogg's Frosted Flakes of Corn Cereal 23Ounce Boxes Pack of 4,e
But I like these Crunchy flakes even though there are only nut specks that have more of a peanut taste.,i
The Crunchy flakes taste sweeter and stay crunchier in milk than the frosted flakes.,i
When I first saw this cereal I thought it would taste likeOatmeal Crisp Cereal Chunky Almonds 17Ounce Box Pack of 6... but it didn't.,e
I do like the taste of this cereal but I prefer more of an almond taste like General Mills than a peanut taste like Kellogg's.,i
However I must say that the Kellogg's flakes have slightly less calories than the General Mills Oatmeal Crisp.If you are looking for a healthy cereal this would not be for you ... LOTS of sugar which I why I guess I like the taste.,i
This is your typical corn flake cereal with small peanut chunks on them.,i
It is a good balance of nuts to cereal and what makes it stand out is a nice hint of molasses.,i
It is about 1/3 sugar so it is a little on the high side but similar in sugar content toHoney Nut Cheerios.,i
I really enjoyed this cereal and am looking forward to buying more.,i
They're corn flakes with a hint of honey and roasted nut sweetness and crunchiness.,i
I had also tried the Crunchy Nut Roasted Nut and Honey the ones shaped like 'O's and that had much more of a roasted peanut taste which wasn't what I was looking for in a cereal although if you're a real peanut lover it would be right up your alley.,i
For just a bit of honey/roasted nut taste I highly recommend the flakes.,i
This answers my need at breakfast to have something tasty and at the same time good for me.I love corn flakes but always needed to put sugar on them for a little extra flavor.,i
This cereal takes care of that.,i
The honey malt molasses and best of all peanuts combine for a terrific and satisfying bowl of goodness.It even tastes good enough to eat without milk but tastes great with milk and added fruit bananas being one of my favorites.Push away from the driveup window and have a bowl of this in the morning  tastes good and better for you,i
Lives up to it's name.,e
It tastes sweeter than 120 calories and 1 gram of fat zero saturated fat.,i
The crunch and the sweet taste reminds me a bit of the frosted flakes I ate as a kid.,i
It starts really crunchy and stays crunchy for a good while.,i
It's a little sweet for me as a daily cereal and it doesn't have the vitamin value of my regular cereal  Total Raisen Bran but will make a nice change from my daily routine.,i
It tastes great right out of the box as a snack.,i
NOTE: It does contain peanuts for those of you that are allergic to them.,i
I enjoyed this cereal.,i
I will probably get it again.I thought it tasted good and the texture was excellent.,i
It never got soggy in milk although I didn't test this to any extreme.,i
The taste of honey wasn't prominent but there was a nut flavor that I enjoyed.My son and grandson also enjoyed it as evidenced by the fact that they just about emptied the box during their weekend visit.Now that said it's nothing really special just a sweetened corn flake style cereal.,i
It's rather sweet too sweet for my wife as I'm writing this she just said that all breakfast cereals belong on the candy isle but probably about the same as frosted flakes.The ingredients bear this out with the first three ingredients being milled corn sugar peanuts followed by honey and a bunch of various things they put in cereal including high fructose corn syrup and salt.So its not a health food store type product.,i
If you're looking for a American style sweetened cereal to enjoy I suggest that you give this stuff a try.,i
Pros:Taste is similar to corn flakes without that wierd aftertasteStays crunchy in milkTastes very good right out of the boxOccasional bite tastes almost like peanut brittleMilk brings out the taste of honeyCons: A bit too sweet for me with milk but kids should love this,i
I presumed two things about the name of this cereal:  1 there would be nuts in it and 2 the nuts would make it crunchy.,i
Hmmm...not so much.Yes they are crunchy but that's from the thick layer of sugar coating on the flakes  and they're just regular corn flakes.,i
But it also makes it very sweet.,i
My teeth hurt eating this cereal it has so much sugar on it.Nuts?,i
Not in my bowl of cereal there weren't.,e
It appears that they covered the flakes with a mixture of sugar and nut dust and that's about all the nuts you're going to get in this cereal.,i
Unless they forgot to put the nuts in my box you won't be finding any in yours either.Thumbs down because the last thing we need is another sugary cereal because it's not new as the box implies and because there are no nuts in it.,i
This is basically sweeten corn flakes with peanuts added.,i
They're okay and I'll probably eat them but there's really nothing special about them.,i
A repackaging of flavors Kellogg's already has.,e
Very sweet so if you like that sort of thing you'll probably enjoy it.,i
Four and half stars really but I rounded up.,i
My family eats a lot of cereal.,e
I'm a Cheerios lover from childhood my daughter generally prefers the chocolate cereals and my son loves Honey Nut Cheerios.So I poured each of us a bowl.,e
A very small one for me since it's very easy for things to taste too sweet to me.It's very crunchy.,i
The milk doesn't seem to affect it at all in the time it takes to eat a bowl and it is very sweet.,i
Like other reviewers have mentioned it tastes a lot sweeter than the calories suggest.,i
The honey taste is pretty faint.,i
The peanut taste is just right.The reason I gave it five stars is that my kids loved it.,i
Both of them thought it was just wonderful and it became their new favorite cereal.,i
Since both are older it's not a fickle decision on their part.,e
My son's previous favorite had been his favorite for the last 10 years.It was too sweet for my tastes.I think it would make a great cracker crust or topping for a fruit crumble.I think for future servings of cereal I'll mix it with regular corn flakes to help cut the sweet a bit.,i
Looks like frosted flakes but tastes betterIt just a yummy crunchy cerealProbably not too good for you but when we eat sugared cereals we don't expect health foodWorth buying,i
I haven't eaten cereals in years and normally ate the sugary types like Fruit Loops Sugar Frosted Flakes Cap'n Crunch and the like mainly as a dry snack because I'm a sugar fiend and like my cereals sweet.,i
When I saw this I decided to try it since I haven't binged on cereal in a few years.I really like this cereal a lot because of the nice crunch corn flakes and sweet but not too sweet honey coating and light peanut taste.,i
To me the peanut taste is really light but other family members noticed the peanut taste easier than I was able to.,i
This works out as an excellent dry snack for me but to be thorough I tried it with whole milk and skim milk for the review.It stayed crunchy during the time I ate it with milk and was pleased with the mouthfeel taste and texture although I prefer it with whole milk rather than skim.,i
I believe I'll start buying some of this cereal since I like it a lot as a snack.,e
I don't eat breakfast so this will always be eaten as a snack by me.If you are a cereal eater I suggest you giving this a try.,e
I'm pretty sure you'll like this too if you do try it.,e
This really is a tasty cereal with a nice crunch.,i
This is an ok new cereal.,e
It tastes like a corn flake with honey and peanuts.,i
I think it would be much better with either strawberries or blueberries.,i
On it's own it was kind of blah.,e
For me there are too many other cereals that I like that are much more nutritious.,i
To imagine the flavor take Frosted Flakes substitute a honey glaze for the frosting and add a few thinly shredded peanuts.,i
It is still sweet though a little less sweet than Frosted Flakes.,i
The peanuts add a light peanut taste along with the corn flakes and honeyno flavor dominates.,i
If that sounds good to you like it did to me then you'll probably love this cereal.,i
If not you may be disappointed.,e
I had pictured these cereals quite differently than what it really is.,e
I am quite disappointed to find that:1 nuts are only peanuts2 I need magnifying glass to see the real peanuts3 cereal is very sweet4 a bowl of cereal and milk is not at all fillingThere is so much sugar honey that the flakes glisten.,i
It is as crunchy as Kellog's corn flakes.,i
They don't get soggy as quickly though  probably the sugar coating delays the process.Serving size is 3/4 cup and has 120 calories 2 fat 7 sodium and 11g sugars.,i
Ingredients in order are corn sugar peanuts honey and so on.,i
As you can see there is more sugar than peanutsIn contrast regular Kellog corn flakes serving size is 1 cup and has 100 calories 0 fat 8 sodium and 2g sugars.We will definitely not buy these cereals.,i
This has just the right amount of sweetness and flavor that makes for a delightful breakfast or snack.,i
The flakes hold their crunch pretty well and there is more flavor there than something like frosted flakes.,i
I think most people will know that in terms of nutrition this is not in the league of some Kashi cereals but most people can read the nutrition information as well.,e
If you are a fan of sweet flake type cereals this is right up your alley and you will enjoy it.,i
The nuts are a bonus though over other offerings and they're not as hard as say some bunches of oats might be.,i
I got this today and started eating it right out of the box as a treat  Yes it's that good :Later I put it in a cereal bowl with sliced bananas blueberries and whole milk and it was excellent.,i
Sweet but not too sweet.,i
At least not for meI stopped eating regular corn flakes years ago because it was so bland tasting and because it got milklogged and mushy in the bowl.,i
This Crunchy Nut cereal did not do that.,i
I truly liked it and it will be on my shelf as a breakfast food and/or a late night snackI would give it a try,e
Kellogg's Crunchy Nut Flakes are in essence Frosted Flakes sugar glazed corn flakes covered with peanut fragments.,i
While I was a bit concerned when the second ingredient listed is sugar when I checked the nutrition info there are only 160 calories a bowl with a 1/2 cup of milk.,i
I know some of Kellogg's healthy cereals with more calories.I found Kellogg's Crunchy Nut Flakes to be sweet but not overpowering with a hint of peanuts.,i
Even in milk they have a good crunch but they can be enjoyed by themselves as well.,i
I didn't know if the peanuts would work on a breakfast cereal but I was pleasantly surprised at the combination.,i
People with peanut allergies should avoid this but I think this is one of those cereals that kids and parents can both enjoy.,i
I have always liked corn flakes.,i
This cereal takes your corn flakes and adds just enough honey to sweeten them and then throws in peanut pieces to add to the crunch and flavor.,i
I have also mixed it with plain corn flakes to give them a bit more punch.,i
It stays crisp in milk and tastes great.,i
Give it a try and I don't think you'll regret your decision.,i
This is a good cereal but relatively high in sugar.,i
Of course my girls enjoyed it because it is sweet.,i
Taste and consistency similar to frosted corn flakes.,i
It is after all toasted cornflakes  of course with nuts.,i
If you like sweet cereals and don't mind the extra calories of the higher sugar the taste is good.,i
If you are looking for a lower sugar alternative good old Product 19 from Kellogs is far healthier.,i
If you are looking for flakes and nuts I would recommend one of higher fiber alternatives like Kirkland Signature Cinnamon Pecan which is also available on Amazon.,e
I really enjoyed these except that about 50 of them were totally broken up in the bag I got.,e
THey are similar to Andy Capp's Hot Fries but with a cheese coating very much like cheddar pringles.,e
A great snack  I brought them to work one day mixed with some cheezits and found myself eating these over the cheezits.,i
They will give you cheddar finger but not as bad as Cheetos.,e
Def will be getting these again but locally so they're not all broken.,e
The GoPicknic Study Fuel Care Package arrived today and the family wanted to check it out.,e
We wanted to see if this would be a good care package at the end of a tough semester or maybe during midterms.,e
The first thing we noticed was the presentation.,e
This is a nice box FILLED with goodies.,e
The box is sturdy and there is no wasted space with stuffing and filler.,e
We sampled the Late July cheese and crackers the Mrs. Mays Cashew Crunch the Pretzel Crisps and opened the Go Picnic Peanut butter cracker snack box.,e
The Clif bar is a regular favorite of my son's and I know several athletes who love the Sharkies.,i
Every item in this package is produced with health and energy in mind.,i
Most of the products resemble common favorite junk food items but are organic vegetarian healthy alternatives.,i
My son LOVED the Late July cheese and crackers.,i
My mother couldn't stop eating the Cashew Crunch and the Annie's cheese bunny crackers from the Go Picnic snack box.,i
Emergence C is a product I have used in the past and is a great drink when you are stressed or coming down with a cold.,i
The Ready to Eat Gourmet on the Go Three Beans with Sweetcorn product was the only thing in the box we found questionable.,i
It was tasty if you like beans.,i
Not exactly what I would consider college kid food.,i
My son said he would probably eat it when he ran out of anything else to eat.All in all this is a far superior care package to the ones offered by the universities my children have attended.,e
Most of them have candy pop tarts mini muffins  lots of empty carbs no protein and lots of fats.,i
Basically empty calories.,i
This package provides healthy fats in the nuts carbs with fiber and protein.,e
All the things a young person needs when they're pulling an all nighter.I asked my son a senior in college if he would appreciate getting a box like this and if he would eat it.,e
He said he would like it and any friends who try to eat healthy would really appreciate it.,i
He was a little concerned that the organic labels would turn some young people off.,e
Then he grabbed the box of Late July cheese and crackers and said MINE.,e
or does this cereal have the lingering taste of corn pops?,i
They even turn soggy like corn pops.,i
I do like corn pops however a cereal that looks like a 'cheerio' and tastes kinda like a corn pop with a not so pleasant aftertase didnt do it for me.,i
it took me a while to write my review because i had to eat the whole box of cereal.it has a delicious taste stays crunchy in milk but the only drawback is that it is a little too sweet for a cereal.,i
it tastes more like a granola bar a sweet granola bar.,i
i would buy this again but i would mix it with some other non sweet cereal like cheerios or corn flakes.,i
this cereal alone is a little sweet but if that's what you like then you will LOVE this cereal.it really has a delicious taste.,i
Open the box and the aroma will hit you Its a delicious smell like honey roasted nuts.,i
The Os are smaller than cheerios and much cruchier.,i
The honey flavor is throughout the O and not just a coating on the outside.,i
The actual O tastes somewhat like a corn pop only much crunchier and with a hint of nut flavor.Eat this out of the box and your hands won't be sticky like they are with the cheerios version.,i
They make a great snack.,e
Eat them in a bowl of milk and they hold up well against the milk and do not get soggy.This is a great cereal that I will be sure to have in my pantry from now on.,i
My 4 year old likes this cereal and I like giving it to him because it isn't garbage like frosted flakes etc.This cereal has a sweet taste without being too sweet.,i
I don't think it has a noticeable nut taste to it like you might think.,i
Definitely stays crisp in milk as others have indicated.Serving size is .75 cups 100 calories less than Special K 1g fat 23g carbs 10g sugars 2g dietary fiber 2g protein.No partially hydro oils No high fructose corn syrup,i
It's hard to say that I like Crunchy Nut cereal.,i
It basically tastes like Cheerios with some nutty sugar sprinkled on top.,i
It's not a super healthy cereal it's not particularly original but the taste and crunch are fine.I wound up sprinkling my Crunchy Nut cereal onto desserts to make crunchy treats rather than eating it as a cereal.,i
My goto cereal is plain old raisin bran and I don't see that changing anytime soon.So as a dessert item Crunchy Nut cereal is very good.,e
As a breakfast item I think I'm fine with throwing my own sugar on my Cheerios when the mood strikes me.,i
I don't really need that to come prepacked for me.,e
As my wife and I have been calorie counting for a while now we're always on the lookout for lower calorie snacks.,i
Particularly sweet ones.,i
I ordered theSnackwell Fudge Drizzle Caramel Popcorn 5.3Ounce Pack of 6through Vine in the past and we both loved those enough to actually buy it again a few times.,e
This one not so much.I eat a lot of protein bars and I'd compare these brownie bites to the driest of the bars I've eaten though not as dense of course.,i
They were like little chocolatey sponges and I found myself needing a glass of milk which just turned it into a slightly chalky paste in my mouth.,i
Not terribly appetizing and it defeats the purpose of a lowcalorie snack if I have to add another 90 calories of skim milk.Still it's not all bad as the taste is pretty good; almost like a chocolate fudge pop tart good or bad your call and it did satisfy my sweet tooth for the most part.,i
But when I'm counting my calories I'd rather have spend it on one delicious treat than on a bag full of chocolate biscuits.,i
Needless to say these will not be finding its way onto our shopping list like the other Snackwell treats did.,e
At around 4 bucks a box about 16 bucks for a pack of 4 boxes and 6 crackers per box these crackers run about 67 cents apiece.,e
For a dollar I can get a 2ounze bag of cheezits a nature valley granola bar a 2pack of pop tarts animal crackers or chips out of the vending machines at work.I usually don't eat snack foods but when I do it's usually because I get hungry at work... so I think comparing the pricing of these individuallywrapped crackers w/ work vending machine prices is valid.,e
Bottom line there is price seems equivalent to or maybe slightly higher than similar snacks from a vending machine.These crackers are tasty  the cracker is crispy the cheesy filling is flavorful  but I'm not that impressed with them overall.,e
I'd rather go fulljunkfood and have a nice bag of CheezIts or stay healthy and eat carrots or fruit for less .,e
These are multigrain cracker 'sandwiches' stuffed with sharp cheddar cheese filling in between.,i
The crackers taste good  do have the regular multigrain taste.,i
However the cheddar filling taste so so.,i
Unlike some other cheddar products that retain the nice flavor and taste of cheddar e.g.,i
cheezit these ones have a 'floury' taste and I didn't like it so much.,i
Very good crackers especially for gluten free.,i
Taste a little like cheez its.,i
Very expensive given size of bags would prob still order again.,e
Other reviewers compared these to goldfish or cheezits.,i
No way  First they have that sandy powdery feel that so many gluten free baked goods have.,i
Plus they are really lacking in cheese flavor.,i
I'll probably use them with chili or in crab cakes.,i
But as something to snack on I'd have to be really desperate.,e
I recently switched to this brand of raisin bran cereal because of the simplicity of its ingredients.,i
It tastes slightly different than the Kellogg's brand but it is no less tasty and its ingredients are a bit healthier.,i
The only problem I have is that they do not list any preservatives of any kind and I find it hard to believe they have done nothing to preserve the cereal.Ingredients: Whole grain wheat raisins wheat bran sugar wheat flour malted barley flour salt.1 Cup Serving Nutrition Facts:Calories: 190 minus 32 calories for indigestible fiber leaves a net of 158Fat: 1 gram no trans fatCarbohydrates: 46 grams with 8 grams of fiberProtein: 5 gramsPost Raisin Bran is fortified with vitamins and minerals including: reduced iron niacinamide zinc oxide vitamin B6 vitamin A palmitate vitamins B1 B2 B12 D and folic acid.,i
This provides 2 percent of the daily value of calcium 10 percent of vitamin D 15 percent of vitamin A zinc and copper 20 percent daily value of phosphorus and 25 percent of thiamin riboflavin niacin vitamins B6 and B12 and magnesium.,i
It also contains 50 percent daily value of folic acid and 60 percent of the daily value of iron.,i
Post Raisin Bran cereal is excellent There are no trans fats and there is no high fructose corn syrup either That's a step in the right direction for me because I need to lose weight The cereal is tasty too; the raisins help to make it taste great and it stays fresh in the box for a few months after I open it so there's little chance of this ever going stale before I eat it.,i
There's also very little fat 1 gram and some protein and fiber that make it healthy to eat.,i
As another reviewer correctly notes this raisin bran cereal also has iron folic acid some vitamin D and vitamin Aand a host of other vitamins in it.,i
True there isn't 100 of everything you need but nevertheless the ingredients and nutritional value of this raisin bran cereal make it one of the better healthier choices for people to eat.I can't really think of too many negatives about this cereal.,i
As of the time I am writing this you may be able to get this product a bit cheaper at a brick and mortar store near you.,i
Overall Post Raisin Bran cereal gives me a healthy start to my day which is critical because I must lose weight.,i
I can The extra little bit you'll pay for thisplus the shipping feeis what you can choose to pay if you want the convenience of having this cereal delivered directly to your doorstep.,e
I highly recommend this cereal.,e
I've sworn of cereals like corn flakes and such and I eat these with some milk almonds a slice of cheese and a banana all mixed in.,i
Great stuff and very healthy.,i
tasty high in fiber yes and carbs but its a cereal not too sweet.,i
I mix it with all bran flax seed meal and wheat bran for a high density nutrient breakfast,i
For all you health conscious people who still need your chocolate fix I'm sure this is a great cereal for you and your kids.,i
I guess we are just too used to thinking chocolate is supposed to taste like cocoa pebbles or chocolate frosted flakes.,i
Yes super chocolatey and super sugary.,i
I know I'm not the only one who loves that.,i
This was too bland for us but still o.k.,i
I wouldn't buy it again but will finish off the 4 boxes and go back to our tried and true :  SS was a great deal for this though.,e
What can I say.....we love cheezits  These arrived on time and were very fresh.,e
It didn't take us long to devour them  I will definitely be ordering again,e
This is a handy quantity to have ready for school lunches AND for portion control for cheezit freaks like me  who can mindlessly munch thru half a box in front of the TV   but they're SO GOOD,e
This may not be cheezits fault but... our package came as if run over by a semi  with a pack of 3 boxes of 12 36 small bags of cheezits crumbs.On an up side... we were able to take all the crumbs and ues them in a mexican dip as one of the layers.,e
tasty yet odd but not unpleasantly so.,i
These have a great taste and snap crackle and pop just as much as the original rice krispies.,i
They make fantastic rice krispies treats  a healthy breakfast.,i
Made with brown rice you get more nutrition out of this product than many of the other GF cereals out there.,e
Highly recommend,e
I started buying these when they first came out and was thrilled to have a gluten free version of rice krispies at the same price as regular.,e
Then the local stores stopped carrying them for whatever reason and I was very disappointed.,e
It's great to find them on here and at the subscribe and save price they're more affordable than the tiny boxes of organic speciality rice krispies imitators that are still available in the local store.,e
I don't need organic or whatever I just need it sans gluten.,i
These fit the bill just fine and make terrific peanut butter rice krispies treats.,i
As always this product was the best.,e
I do love rice krispies and these are almost as good as the regular ones....,e
Addictive.,i
Sometimes I have to work hard at limiting myself to just one a day.,e
These are amazing.,e
It's a high quality pastry without the gluten or wheat.,i
I love the texture soft yet a little crunchy at the same time might be the chia seeds.,i
I think I'll try warming these up a little for a pop tart kind of sensation.,i
YUM,i
These are a pretty good replacement if you're really into cocoa krispies but they don't turn the milk as dark as the chemical concoction put out by Kellogg's.,i
The flavor is relatively good but it's not as chocolatey as some might be hoping.,i
Overall it makes a good snack but it is not at all filling as far as a breakfast cereal goes.,e
Seems to mix best with sweetened milks such as almond milk; regular milk and goat milk left it a little plainer tasting.Also worth noting that this cereal tastes pretty good dry if not better than it tastes with milk.Note: it doesn't snap crackle or pop.,i
It tastes good and is good for ya It's filling too  What's not to love?,i
For a 1/3 cup serving you get 130 calories 3.5 grams of fat 22 grams of carbs a whopping 5 grams of fiber 3 grams of protein and only 6 grams of sugar.I must say though if you're not used to eating health foods like this you may not like it.,i
I am not the kind that likes frosted miniwheats or lucky charms.,i
This granola is my kind of food.,i
It's not gonna taste like pop tarts but it does taste good for what it is.I like snacking on it by itself or pouring milk over some and warming it up in the microwave for a late night snack,i
I'm usually a cereal man when it comes to breakfast.,e
That is unless of course there's donuts or pancakes.,e
But most of the time I try to stick with a healthy type of cereal rather than Lucky Charms or something of that nature.,i
My two favorites are usually raisin bran or frosted mini wheats but this has worked its way into my regular rotation.,e
They are nice and cruncy with just enough brown sugar sweetness to be tasty without overpowering your taste buds.,i
Sometimes I mix them 5050 with the cinnamon flavored and have a nice brown sugar  cinnamon flavor.,i
Also it's nice and hearty so it doesn't leave me hungry after only 30 minutes.,i
Definitely recommended.,e
I love cereal.,e
I eat a lot of it.,i
And while these Oatmeal Squares are good they won't be replacing my usual brands on my shopping list.,e
There isn't much that is distinctive or special about this cereal.,e
This is marketed as a healthy cereal but when I compared the nutritional information on the box to that on the other boxes of cereal in my cupboard it didn't stand out on that front either.,e
With respect to whether or not I would recommend this cereal I'm sort of neutral on that.,e
As I said I like it fine I just don't love it.,e
If you have had other Quaker brand cereals and liked them or if you like other oatbased cereals then you might want to try this one.,e
Seems to me there was a different version of this cereal around some years ago that rather resembled Life.,e
Be that as it may this cereal in no way resembles Life and requires a bit of a commitment.,e
It's very hearty holds up superbly in milk and is only kind of sweet.,i
In short a bowlful can't be scarfed down like frosted flakes or fruit rings; it demands your attention for the duration.,i
This is good because one should pay attention to what one eats.,i
It would be nice if there was a little more flavor to devote one's attention to though.,i
There is some both of oats and cinnamon but they're rather overwhelmed by the sheer bulk of the pieces.,i
All in all I'd give them average marks on their own and recommend them as a mixer with other cereals that have a lighter and perhaps sweeter character.,i
Quaker Oatmeal Squares are smaller in size than one would expect especially in comparison with some other cereals.,e
The dietary information is encouraging as there is fairly low sodium 190 mg per 1 cup serving and 5 grams of dietary fiber along with 6 grams of protein.One of the things I first noticed about the cereal was its ability to remain crisp long after some other cereals had given way to sogginess.,i
This is a real plus for my money.,e
The box was 14.5 ounces as advertised and comes in one of those pouches that must be cut with a pair of scissors to open.,e
All told it is a nice alternative to the spoon size shredded wheat and the raisin bran cereal that more frequently winds up on the breakfast menu.,e
Try it there's a good chance you'll like it.,e
I'm usually a cereal man when it comes to breakfast.,e
That is unless of course there's donuts or pancakes.,e
But most of the time I try to stick with a healthy type of cereal rather than Lucky Charms or something of that nature.,e
My two favorites are usually raisin bran or frosted mini wheats but this has worked its way into my regular rotation.,e
They are nice and cruncy with just enough cinnamon and sweetness to be tasty without overpowering your taste buds.,i
Also it's nice and hearty so it doesn't leave me hungry after only 30 minutes.,i
Definitely recommended.,e
When you open the bag it smells similar to pringles but as you get closer it has an unplesant smell of oil.,i
Taste like the fried chips we get at our local chinese place with salt added.,i
As to salt these are not saltier than regular potato chips.,i
These are really no healthier than a regular potato chip the only difference is these are made of sweet potatos navybeans rice and carrot instead of white potatoes.I could only taste the salt no onion taste for me.,i
Would have prefered a heavier onion or garlic taste to override the nasty chemical bean aftertaste.,i
Aftertaste reminds me of the taste you get with some gluten free products made with bean flour.,i
Even though these say expire august of 2013 the oil smelled and tasted like it was beginning to turn rancid like it does in organic chips and crackers.4 stars because my 12 and 15 year old kids actually liked these chipsand said they wanted me to buy more.,i
They love anything fried.,i
Summary my kids liked and want more; so if you love greasy fired chips and cna get fresh onesyou might like them.,i
Me I will not eat them.,i
Some background information:My kids eat a whole foods diet.,i
They don't like the taste of chemically laden products they refused to eat pop tarts when offered by semievil relatives and they do not eat junk food like Cheetos and the like.Everyone of us loved these chips.The flavor is wholesome  not artificial.,i
They definitely taste like an indulgent snack food but not like one dowsed in 3 preservatives.,i
They had a wonderful level of saltiness and a texture between a potato chip and freshly made restaurant tortilla chips.,i
The bag was opened at snack time and finished before dinnertime.,e
I was excited to see beans included in the list of ingredients because it's uncommon but they are also very nutritious.We've been entirely unimpressed with Veggie Stix and Pirate Booty.,i
So far these were the best thing they've loved since we discovered Terra chips a long time ago.,e
A quality food snack with great flavor and texture.,i
If you're extremely sensitive to bitter tastes there is an underlying bitter flavor that I detected.,i
Maybe from the seasonings or maybe from the beans but it wasn't so overpowering that it kept my kids away.,e
I planned to eat these myself but my 5 year old caught me then the 3 and 7 year old got in on the act.,e
Oh well.,e
Good bye chips.,e
At least my KIDS are snacking on something healthy.,i
As someone always on the go I love my snack bars.,e
I also have a weakness for chocolate.,i
I found these bars just ok.,e
They had an odd sweet after taste.,i
I also didn't find any 34;fiber difference34; than any other regular snack bar.,i
I'm going to stick to my fiber one and special k bars.,e
Convenient size bottle  Use in all my baking needs from homemade waffles to corn flake marshmallow treats to cookies  Definitely no complaints here,e
the mozzarella taste is mild but I can taste it.,i
It still tastes like a cheezit mostly and that is why I gave it five stars...because cheezits are awesome.,i
orginial is of course the best but this is still pretty good.,e
If you like original cheezits you will like this because of how much like an original cheezit it tastes.,i
They make a great alternative to the white cheezits if white cheezits are your bag.,e
I'm not a huge fan of the original cheezits but these mozzarella cheezits are wonderful.,i
They're made with both mozzarella and cheddar cheese and you can definitely taste the cheddar.,i
But the mozzarella gives them a milder butterier taste than a normal cheddar cracker.,i
They are also not too salty which is often a problem with cheese crackers.At 150 calories for 25 crackers a few handfuls this is a great snack.,i
They take the edge of your hunger without filling you up with empty calories.They are a little greasy so you'll want to have a napkin or a sink hand when you eat them.,i
The crackers in my box were almost all broken which made it a little harder to eat them.,e
But those are relatively minor drawbacks and this is certainly a product that I'll eat again.,i
I really haven't found a cheezit cracker that I do not like and the Mozzarella one's are no different.,i
They are mild in flavor and kind of a little creamery tasting than most of the other cheezits that I have tried.,i
They are bursting with flavor as usual but without being overpowering.,i
If you like Mozzarella cheese and you like cheezits then I think you'll love this product.,e
These were good.,e
I didn't have regular cheezeits around to compare them too but if memory serves then these were cheesier and better.,i
There are definitely some better flavors of cheezits out nowadays but I can't imagine myself turning these things down at a party or anywhere else.,i
These are delicious I opened the box a little weary not knowing if these would be good or not ate one and did not stop eating them until I had made quite a dent in the box.,e
They are so hard to put down The box says they are creamy and mild and that is a perfect description for these.,e
The cheese flavor is not as strong as the original which can be a nice change.I gave them 4 stars instead of 5 because I believe no matter how good any of these cheezit flavors are nothing will beat the original.,i
First: purchasing crackers through the mail is a dicey proposition.,e
These arrived and literally half the box was crumbs.,e
So a small portion of the three stars above which would be 2.5 if I could comes from the fact that it was difficult to find a whole cracker in the box.,e
If this happens to you do what we did: use them as crumb topping on a casserole.Second: At 5 dollars a box they ring in at nearly twice the price of the same product at my local grocery...so you should probably check out your local grocery if you need to get your cheezit fix.,e
They tasted fine...just not like the cheese whose name they wear.,i
The best flavours are original the duoz with the smoked cheese flavour and Swiss.,i
There is too the problem of powdery residue on your fingers after snacking...a big plus of the original flavour is a total lack of this and a much more cheesey flavour.,i
These are great my son likes them.,e
They are not the best for you but are better then the quaker oats brand and if your on the special k plan it works into it well.,e
I love raisin bran and often throw in some extras including nuts.,i
This new cereal does that for me as well as adding a hint of cinnamon.,i
I'm not such a big fan of cinnamon for breakfast but the cereal was still very good maybe a little too sweet for my tastes.,i
I usually use an extra raisin bran cereal with no added sugar.,i
Recommend that people who are looking for something different give this cereal a try.,e
I found this to be a very tasty alternative to the regular raisin bran.,e
The flakes are crunchier  not as crunchy as the Raisin Bran Crunch version but certainly more so than the regular version.,i
A nice compromise.The cinnamon flavor is nicely balanced  not too strong but you don't have to wonder where it is.,i
There's a good amount of raisins but the almonds are rather sparse.The downside is that this version has a bit less fiber than the regular version.,i
It has 5g per serving which is 21 of the recommended daily amount versus 7g per serving 28 of the recommended daily amount in the regular version.,i
The Cinnamon Almond version has about the same calories as the regular 200 per serving which is 1.25 cups versus 190 per serving in the regular which is 1 cup.,i
Fat and sugar content is the same for both.I'm a big raisin bran fan and really liked this.,i
Nice change of pace.,e
I don't eat raisin bran.,e
I got this box of Kellogg's Raisin Bran for my husband who has a bowl of regular raisin bran nearly every night.,e
It turns out that I am eating more of this cereal than he does.,i
I get tired of regular raisin bran; it is just a little boring.,e
This has cinnamon on the raisins and sliced almonds neither of which I just love but with the raisins and bran flakes it all works.,i
Neither the cinnamon nor the almonds are so strong they take over.I am not normally even a cereal breakfast person but this has an extra crunch plenty of raisins a sweet but not too sweet taste and has been exactly what I needed the last few mornings.,i
I got this box through Amazon Vine but I like it enough that I will buy another box.,e
Does my husband the raisin bran authority like it yes but he said it is difficult to improve on Kellogg's Raisin Bran.,e
The cinnamon is light and tasty in these and while I don't really taste the almonds I can sure see them Noteunlike most raisin brans this one has nuggets.,i
As usual for Kellogg's the raisins are soft and delicious.,i
VERY highly recommended,e
I've been eating Kellogg's raisin bran long before the dr. said more fiber  More fiberSo how does Kellogg's improve a staple like raisin bran ?,i
Well  they add cinnamon and almond I've had to subsequently search for this product  as grocery cereal aisles are already burstin' at the seams  but now that I know where I can readily purchase it  I will always have an extra box on hand,e
More fiber  more fiber,i
So many cereals and so few mornings to enjoy them  I remember the time when I would choose between Cheerios or corn flakes now my pantry probably has 15 different cereals including oatmeal; however I have always been a raisin bran fan and often could trick myself into thinking I was eating something healthy bran.,e
18 grams of sugar is not a small amount and with the addition of cinnamon added to the coated sweetened raisins the pandering to children's taste buds is ridiculous.,i
I admit I like the addition of almonds but I believe this has been done before?,i
Using my box of puffed rice naturally sweet as a sort of base comparison I was astonished to contrast it with the Raisin bran ingredients.,i
Puffed rice has no added sugar but is sweet enough while the raisin bran has sugar brown sugar dextrose cinnamon and honey.,i
The last 4 items are under 2 but who needs them.Could I become addicted to this cereal probably yes.,e
But even after the first taste test A full bowl of just raisin bran Cinnamon Almond I knew I would have to mix it with something else Shredded wheat for example to bring down the sugar count and the calories 240 with milk.,i
My general advice is don't give up on basic raisin bran but stay away from the expanded raisin brans.,e
This new product will not revive the cereal industry but push us more toward generic healthier cereals.,e
To me this cereal tastes no different than regular raisin bran except for the fact that it contains almonds.,i
I really could not taste the cinammon; however I do like regular raisin bran so I will eat the rest of the box.,i
I really enjoyed this cereal.Being a big lover of raisin bran cereal I was concerned that the cinnamon would be too overpowering and mess up my classic bowl of Kellogg's Raisin Bran.,e
But no they did and excellent job of keeping the cinnamon nice and light as a compliment to the cereal and added in some little cinnamon roll flavored pieces that gave it just a nice flavor that blended in well.,i
I really enjoyed it and would buy more in the future.,e
If you like both raisin bran cereal and cinnamon I believe you will find this one to your liking.,i
Yummy :o,i
I don't like regular raisin bran but i love this with the cinnamon flavor.,i
My teenage girls also love it.,e
The cinnamon is very noticeable so if you don't like cinnamon you won't like this.,i
I knew I was going to like this cereal what I wasn't pepared for was the fact that I was gonna love itI imagined raisin bran and almonds together.,i
Pretty yummy right?,i
But add in just the perfect amount of cinnamon and you've got the most absolutely delicious breakfast cereal.I give Kellogg's Raisin Bran Cinnamon Almond cereal Five Stars and a big THUMBS UP and highly recommend it to anyone who enjoys Raisin BranDISCLOSURE: This product was provided by Amazon Vine in exchange for an independent and nonbiased review.,i
I am still a fan of old school cold breakfast cereal the kind that just needs milk.,i
Even as an adult I still love it.,i
I have my favorites mostly embedded from my childhood and new varieties that are newer to the market.,e
I would say that Kellogg's Raisin Bran would be considered a favorite from childhood.,e
Therefore when I saw this new spin on Raisin Bran I was quite interested.This Raisin Bran has the addition of almond slivers and dusted with cinnamon.,i
Well I cannot express my disappointment with this cereal.,e
First and foremost the cinnamon I am not sure I would use the term dusted with cinnamon rather dumped with cinnamon.,i
This is all I tasted was cinnamon and it was very very sugary.,i
Secondly the almond slivers were pretty much nonexistent which is sad considering it is promoted on the box.,e
Thirdly this is raisin bran right?,e
Where are the raisins?,i
Did the two scoops that Kellogg's has built their reputation on been reduced to two tablespoon scoops?,e
The taste itself isn't bad per se if you love cinnamon.,i
I would rather just have a bowl of normal Raisin Bran.Kellogg's did a fine job with their Raisin Bran Crunch so I am not sure how they dropped the ball on this cereal.,e
And not for nothing but the box that the cereal comes in itself is very small.,e
This seems to be the case for most companies nowadays smaller packaging higher prices.,e
But in the case of this cereal there is some major deception.,e
The cereal is supposed to have almonds raisins and cinnamon.,i
Well there are barely any almonds or raisins and tons of cinnamon.,i
So it appears that Kellogg's is getting away cheap with this product.,e
Simply by charging more making smaller packaging and skimping on the almonds and raisins and bulking up on cinnamon and bran flakes.,e
I would be really surprised if this product is still on the shelf in six months.,e
I anticipated that it would be very sweet.,i
It was but it also had a pronounced cinnamon flavor.,i
I do not like eating sweetened cereal its too sweet for me.,i
I like to use 1/3 bowl of sweet cereal combined with plain corn flakes bran flakes grape nuts or oat cereal.,i
That dilutes it down to something with flavor and a little sweetness.,i
After trying the MiniWheats with just milk I added the plain and it was just right with a cinnamon twang.,i
Eating it straight it had the taste of a cinnamon roll.,i
So now you can decide from there.Looking at the box it said a serving was 47 pieces.,e
I counted out 47 and the bowl was barely half full.,e
So think about doubling the nutritional numbers if that is important to you.,i
It also means the box will only last for 4 servings.,e
That makes it expensive.,e
Well I'm rating it on the flavor and my choice to water it down.,i
There doesn't seem to be a lot of actual chocolate in this product.,i
I would have thought it'd have a dark chocolate taste but instead it was only vaguely chocolate.,i
Checking the ingredient list it appeared to have a soy based filling with artificial flavors.,i
It reminded me of cheap chocolate candies around the holidays.,e
You might find a milk chocolate easter bunny but you'll also find a chocolate flavored easter bunny.,i
These will look the same but not taste the same.,i
My kids liked it but for something called krave that pushes the chocolate angle on the marketing I was left wanting.,e
I wasn't sure I'd like any cereal that claimed to be double chocolate but I had a chocolate craving when I ordered it so I thought I'd give it a try.I can understand why it's called Krave because after I tried one of the little chocolate pillows I was hooked.,e
I was kind enough to share with my family to see if it was equally appealing to children and teens including an exchange student from The Netherlands who bought a box to take home to his brother since he claims they have no good cereal there,e
It's great to eat dry as a snack or in a bowl of milk.As far as the nutritional part goes it's not too bad.,i
A serving size is 3/4 of a cup and is 120 calories with 3.5 grams of fat.,i
It is 10grams of sugar but that's almost 1/2 the amount of sugar you'd find in Smart Start or raisin bran crunch so it's not too bad and tastes ohsogood.,i
It does contain wheat soy and milk so keep that in mind if you're the allergic type.This is one of those cereals that will be a treat in our house but also one that I'll keep a box hidden somewhere for myself in case of an emergent chocolate craving.,i
Usually I like my peanut butter the old fashioned way.... with just peanut butter in it.,i
I never really liked the stuff with jelly already in it or different flavors etc.,i
This one is an exception.I decided to try it since it's all natural ingredients that's always a plus in my food desires.,i
Since it is natural products you do have to stir it up and it a bit thinner than the processed 'regular' peanut butters.,i
Not too much of an issue at all though.,e
I decided to use it by itself on bread for a pbj; without the j...... and to be honest I didn't miss the jelly at all.,i
It was a tad bit on the drier side since there was no jelly but the flavor of the raspberries chocolates and other goodies made up for it entirely.This would go great on crackers bread of almost any type it didn't do too badly on a chocolate pop tart either.,i
I have four hungry boys and they all love this cereal and you can't beat Amazon's price and it arriving on your doorstep.,e
They love it with milk but it is also very tasty if they are running late for school and can grab a baggie full of it for the car w/o the milk.I am sure that it isn't as healthy for you as raisin bran or shredded wheat but oh well.,i
They eat well the rest of the day :,i
I like this cereal...,e
I have eaten it with 2 milk and unsweetened almond milk.,i
The freeze dried berrys remind me of when they first tried them in corn flakes cereal many years ago.,i
They were good then and good now.,e
Wish I tried this cereal sooner,e
Guys: Although this doesn't pack the vitamin/mineral punch that Total has this is a tasty low fat cereal at a good price.,i
Although it IS a processed food processed rice added sugar etc.,i
I like that it's not just  strawberry flavored bits or heavy yogurtycovered raisins and such.......it's real freezedried strawberries ok they're not fresh but that's not a problem for me...I LOVE dried fruit in my cereal.,i
It's also a convenient way to get real strawberry taste in my cereal and it stays fresh.,i
It's one of my go to cereals out there.,e
The only negative is that it's a tiny bit too sweet for me it looks like they spray a very light sugar coating on the flakes not like frosted flakes but still not needed for my taste.It may not beat the sale price of boxed cereal at Costco or a discount supermarket outside NYC but compared to typical boxed cereal prices in NYC 3.39 per 16.7 oz box is a very good price most brand cereal in a nondiscount supermarkets here cost about 5.99/box and they are rarely above 14 oz per box.,i
I switch between Kellogg's and Post's respective versions of raisin bran since each has its pluses.,e
Post has the flake portion down pat  large flakes with a nice crunch.,e
In contrast the Kellogg's flakes are smaller,e
As an aside the Kellogg's flakes work better than Post when using the cereal as an addin for baking multigrain breads or oatmeal cookies.But raisins are part of the equation as well.,i
I usually get Kellogg's since I can live with their less than great flakes and they usually cost less good sales on Amazon plus I can get the jumbo boxes at Sam's Club.,e
But if only these two companies would collaborate  flakes by Post raisins by Kellogg's.,e
That would be perfect,e
Not a huge fan of Kellog's Raisin Bran for a variety of reasons:1.,e
Relative to other flakey cereals Special K Total etc.,e
the flakes are sometimes not always fresh I don't know about Amazon's batch and it really makes the cereal sort of gummy and yucky2.,i
In general the flakes themselves even when fresha re not real crunchy admittedly they are bran flakes not pure rice wheat or corn flakes so they seem more like a bran fiber cereal and they get mushy in milk pretty quickly.3.,i
Amazon used to have a fourpack for nearly the same price so this is not a big savings anymore with the threepack pricey NYC stores typically always have Kellog's Raisin Bran on sale and it's usually 2.99/20 oz box.On the plus side I DO like the raisins.,e
They're plump and not sugary coated.,i
I love popcorn as an occasional treat.,i
I can only tolerate near hull less popcorn and this product is just that.,i
I use avocado oil and the corn pops up fluffy and delicious.,i
GMOfree as well.,i
These Quaker Stila Crispy Oat Bars are delicious.,i
The perfect cross between a cookie and your traditional nutri grain style granola bar they are a great snack.,e
We have been watching our diets recently and these seem to be a better choice than many other granola barswith only 100 calories about 30 less than what we normally eat and they don't seem any less filling.,i
I love Kellogg's NutriGrain Strawberry Cereal Bars and from the picture and product description these reminded me of them so I decided to give them a try.,e
I am always looking for a new healthy snack to snack on at work.When I first opened the packaging the cookie part of the bar reminds me kind of like a pop tart crust.,e
Feels the same way too just has oats instead of the pop tart frosting.,i
But when I bit into it it taste nothing like a pop tart.,i
The filling kind of did not as sweet but the outside cookie part tasted bit salty and I don't know...flat?,i
The crunch almost feels stale.,i
Just doesn't have very much taste appeal.There isn't much strawberry filling and the filling is a bit dry itself.,i
It is nothing like the strawberry in the nutrigrain bars and it is a bit sour.,i
It is has a small coating on the bottom of the cookie and after that is it is pretty much hollow.,i
When you bite down on it it collapses in on itself and starts to crumble around the edges.I think I will stick with the Kellogg's Nutrigrain bars...much better tasting.,i
These aren't absolutely horrid but they're way too sweet and light for my taste I like a heartier bar and WAY less sugar.,i
If you're an adult pop tart eater these would be a good somewhat less embarrassing option.The filling is pure pop tartthe number  ingredient of the filling is high fructose corn syrup followed by sugar apple powder dextrose glycerin with blueberry at 6 on the list and artificial colors and preservatives rounding out the filling ingredients.,i
The crust is a bit more grown up than pop tarts a bit lighter with a scattering of whole grains.The only selling point I can see is the 2g of fiber and the 100 caloriesbut you could get twice the fiber and fewer calories from a piece of fruit or wholegrain toast yeah I know fruit isn't shelfstable and can't survive in your car's glove box for a year.,i
But it your diet is mainly processed convenience foods this is much less objectionable than some alternatives hence the 2 stars.I do find it a bit telling that both the ingredients and front label mention that it contains blueberry instead of blueberries.,i
A new take on the NutriGrain snack bar.This snack bar has just a hint of sweetness has a crunchy crust similar to a baby cookie and not too much filling.,i
The top is also spinkled with granola.,i
Still though in theory a great change on the nutrigrain bar there is a slightly chemical aftertaste that really detracts from the whole experience.,i
Filling has the same strawberry flavor of a pop tart just with less sweetness.In the end just a soso snack bar in my humble opinion.,i
These are similar to pringles in that they are made of reconstituted potato flakes that are then flavored.,i
Buttttttt they are way more expensive.,e
I really like about half the flavors I sort of liked a few and a few were really bad.,i
All in all it was nice to get a variety but not worth the price.,e
It's oatmeal.,i
And it has too much stuff in it for my taste.,i
It's REALLY sweet.,i
19 grams of sugar.,i
This is oatmeal for people who demand Frosted corn flakes instead of adding a bit of sugar to their corn flakes.I normally eat oatmeal and I normally add some berries for sweetening.,i
But this goes too far.,e
It adds so MUCH stuff.,i
Enough nuts tasty nuts for 8 grams of fat.,i
8 grams isn't a lot  but it's a lot for oatmealIf you gotta have the sweet stuff for breakfast and you need to add fiber it has 5 grams  that's good then look at this.,i
But it's not for me.,e
pop tarts in my house go so fast so this lasted me a while.,e
they came and none of them were broken up.,e
i just wish that there was a cinnamon kind in there instead of 2 strawberry.,i
The flavor of the chips themselves is a bit earthy...if you've ever eaten fairly plain lentils it has a distinct lentilly flavor.,i
The pizza flavor is pretty tasty in my opinion  not overly seasoned but each chip is flavorful.,i
I don't think it really tastes like pizza that much or like other pizzaflavored products like pizza pringles or pizza combos just has some onion garlic parsley and other natural flavors.,i
But it's tasty anyhow.The texture of the chips is what makes me give it 4 stars.,i
It's not unpleasant but it is a lot more brittle than other kinds of chips kind of like a hard sponge or a pita chip if pita chips were more light puffed and holey.,i
So after eating half the bag the roof of my mouth is a bit scraped up.Then again I just have poor self control with my snacking sometimes and most people probably don't eat half a bag at once.,i
In which case it wouldn't be a problem.,e
Like little pop tarts.,e
I don't see how this line of pastry crisps are being called healthy.,i
Won't try again.,i
I have been eating Kellogg's brand raisin bran for years.,e
Unfortunately for some reason the quality varies from batch to batch.,e
The most recent box was great.,e
Fresh crisp flakes plump moist raisins.,i
I have had boxes with stale flakes and driedout raisins.,i
I cannot account for the difference.,e
In all instances the boxes were still well within the best by date.,e
Kellogg may be suffering quality control issues.,e
When the box is good the cereal is great.,e
The raisins are slightly sweetened with sugar.,i
The cereal overall is enjoyable flavorful and a decent source of fiber.,i
How does one review one of the long time favorites in cereals?,i
I only know that if I buy other brands of raisin bran my husband asks me to get the best 34;that Kellogg kind34;.,i
Generous amount of raisins  and not an excessive amount of sugar and he reports that it is part of his good health regime.,i
Given that he stays remarkably healthy I will accept that.,i
she asked me to get raisin bran since we've known each other.,i
she has loyalty in this brand.,e
so i buy it for her.,e
Honey Nut Cheerios are great.,e
I like them because they are super fresh and crunchy.,i
They have just the right amount of sweetness for menot too sicky sweet like some cereals.,i
These are small 12.25 oz boxes which may be the normal size for these but 18 oz boxes like of corn flakes are large boxes.,i
Box tops for education too.,e
My grandsons are in boarding school.,e
The really like their pop tarts because they are a quick breakfast when they are in a rush in the morning.,e
They also make nice snacks in the evening if they can just keep them long enough before friends eat them up,i
When my sister visited us one of the issues that came up wasn't about baked items  those we had under control.,i
The issues for us really were more about the fried foods you bread or flour including especially the American Favorite  Fried Chicken.We did end up using glutenfree corn flakes and glutenfree rice krispies but there was just something different with not being able to fry in flour.,i
So when I had the chance I decided to sample this so that I could decide if this would work for her.I made the chicken using the flour with the same normal measurements of salt and pepper dredged the chicken pieces in the flour I used boneless skinless breasts cut into chunks then fried it on the stove top.I noticed I did have to turn the temperature up a bit extra to get these browned but it could have been the oil I was using as well.,i
After the chicken was done I then used the drippings to make gravy.,i
I simply added in some of the leftover flour mixture fried it and added milk.,i
It did not seem to brown up as much and it really didn't thicken as dramatically as flour would have but it did make a decent gravy if a bit light in color.So my answer is an emphatic yes It makes a lovely fried chicken and a tasty gravy to put alongside of it,i
My whole family enjoys these crackers.,e
They look just like cheezits and taste very similar they have a lightly more 34;real34; cheese flavor.34;  If you are loking to go more 34;natural34; I think these are a great choice.,i
If you used them in a snack mix I doubt anyone would know the difference,e
They are good.,i
Even my husband liked them.,i
They are not cheezits but they are good and healthy and made from real food not chemicals and won't kill me.,i
The strongest flavor in this chip is the malt powder not garlic nor parmesan but I don't see malt as an ingredient  there is potato starch so that may explain the crunch.,i
They are not grainy but satisfyingly crunchy without becoming rock hard.,i
I wouldn't buy these again but they were easy to eat unlike many grainy crackers.,e
They are better in texture than the baked cheese crisps from Pepperidge Farm which tends to get gummy like a cheezit near the end of the chomp and not particularly crackerish in that you don't immediately think that you are eating a dried flatbread.,i
These are quite thick and not as crumbly given their thickness.This item can be purchased by the bag but the other variations are only available in an order of six.,i
I love cheezits so I thought I'd try this different cheese flavor.,i
I also love provolone cheese so......sounds like a winning combination but it was NOT.,i
I found flavor to be severely lacking.,i
I didn't mind paying almost 5 for this small box of cheezits when I was sure I'd love it according to all the great reviews but I did not love it not even liked them.,e
I am sure I will eventually eat them over time because they are not discusting ....just blahhhh.,i
If they turn stale over time that'll solve my problem of what to do with a product I don't really like.,i
Discard  I truly did not find the provolone flavoring to be strong enough to translate to my taste buds.,i
If you find these good I am happy for you but even my sister who loves cheezits too said she did not like this flavor.,i
There are many other new cheese flavors available now so I am hoping some of them will be better than this one.,i
very good its what I expected from cheez it  I love the provolone taste,i
Reading the description of the Wish Bone Italian Dressing reminded me that I used to use Hidden Valley Ranch dry mix as a coating for baked chicken and absolutely loved it.,e
I tried coating chicken pieces with this Italian dressing in two different ways  once mixed with crushed corn flakes and once as a seasoning by itself.,i
Both were tasty but quite bland.,i
I do like chicken with a zing so I was disappointed with both attempts.,i
If you are cooking for kids or people on a more bland diet this would probably be a good choice.,i
I'll probably just make a salad dressing with the other envelope as I know that has a little zip to it.,i
I love the taste of these gluten free pop tarts.,i
I will not purchase them often though because they are not organic nor is there any mention of being nonGMO.,e
It's nice to have as a treat every now and again.,i
For more info on health and gluten free living recipes and product recommendations and also frugal selfsufficiency free to check out my blog: ...,e
Pretty tasty pop tart alternative.,i
Doesn't have any weird GF aftertastes like a lot of GF products.,i
Handy to have around for something quick.,e
A bit spendy compared to regular pop tarts but certainly not the worst price difference I've seen in the gluten free grocery world.,e
I added them to my subscribe and save list to cut the cost down a bit.,e
You couldn't tell that this was gluten free.,i
Lots of dough.,i
Normally I love doughy foods but there's hardly any strawberry filling in these.,i
I was tasting more dough than anything.,i
Also these come wrapped individually.,e
With pop tarts you get six three pairs which is more filling but for those who eat half a pair separate packaging is more practical I suppose.,e
I would love to try the apple flavor but I was reading another review that said something about mold with the apple.,i
The dough is not good the flavor is almost tasteless.,i
I have had way better gluten free foods but Glutino pop tarts are just not good at all.,i
These are surprisingly good; they could use a bit more filling in ratio to the crust though.,i
They are not as sweet as a pop tart but our resident threeyearold loves them so they are kidtested and approved.,e
My grandson loves these.,i
He is a senior in high school and was diagnosed when he was 15.,e
It is very hard on teenagers when they have to change their diet so much.,i
These look like pop tarts and he can travel with these on school functions.,e
Sometimes he adds some squeeze on icing to add a little change.,i
He did mention he wished they had more strawberry filling in them.,i
All in all we order these often.,e
basically a pop tart but not as overloaded with sugar and crap.,i
wish these were a little cheaper though.,e
tastes very good.,i
They taste pretty good and have a pretty similar texture to normal pop tarts.,i
That being said adding some sort of frosting on the top would make them 10x better as they are just a bit plain for my liking.,i
There is not too many wonderful things to be said about gluten free food but these actually taste almost like real pop tarts.,i
I wolud buy them again and recommend it to friends.,e
i like pringles very much its good to have around as a anytime snack you get a 3 count can and its a good deal,e
If you want original pringles that is what this is.,e
If you want a salty snack food be aware that the original pringles has a distinctive taste.,i
Hubby and I cannot decide if this flavor or the Chipotle are our favorite and the taste trials continue.,i
They are thinner than a standard cheezit and have a powerful flavor.,i
Cheezy and spicy but not too much so.,i
I would say this one may have a more subtle flavor and you can taste a bit more of the corn in these but both flavors are really gooddefinitely cheesy with a little zing to them.,i
I think they have a winner with this new line.,e
We are loving them  Plan to continue buying them as they are delicious straight out of the box,e
The zip in these Zingz has me hooked.,e
The flavor and light but crunchy texture are both to my liking.,i
It's rather like the cheezit I remember from my younger years is now all grown up.,e
I haven't ever been too crazy about alternative cheezit flavors but this one is really good.,i
I thought the spice would make a smaller amount seem more satisfying but they are so good it's kind of tough to stop at just a couple.,i
Definitely recommend,e
All kinds of flavors are hitting the snack market these days.,i
Kettle Chips in particular made waves a few years ago with oldfashioned supposedly morenaturallymade potato chips and now coats those chips with every bizarre combination of flavors maple syrup and bacon?,i
Really under the sun.These new Cheezits taste really neat but I get why they had to pick a funny name to describe them.,i
Queso Fundido literally means melted cheese in Spanish but the phrase is traditionally used to refer to a traditional dish: chorizo and spices in the middle of an oily puddle of melted white cheese.,i
There's no mention of chorizo anywhere on this package of course,e
But fear not: these 'zings' aren't spicy hot just a bolder flavor than your average Cheezit.,i
I can taste the pepper flavor the parsley and the cumin of course 'artificial flavor' is also listed on the ingredients list and probably makes up most of what you're tasting.I liked these crackers for a quick latenight snack and so did my girlfriend a notorious snacker.,i
They disappeared quickly,e
These are seriously addicting.,i
I didn't think there was anything better than regular cheezits but these Zingz definitely beat them out.,i
The flavor is so tasty and I am obsessed with the texture of these.,i
I can easily demolish an entire box in one sitting.,e
These crackers have an amazing flavor Chessy and a bit of tomato too.,i
Though the box shows a picture of a pepper they are not spicy at all.,e
They are kind of thick like cheezit crackers and very tender too.,i
Serving size is 18 crackers and that's about  a cup but good luck stopping here these crackers are highly addictive Great snack and satisfying.Like with any other food item I encourage you to read all ingredients and nutrition list before purchasing.,i
we are looking for them at the store already.,e
I loved cheezit crackers especially as a kid and these new zingz rock the house.... Thinner than a cheezit and bigger with a cheesy taste and a zing of chipotle pepper but not too much zing mind you.,i
These were perfect snacking out of the box but would be great with soup with a topping cheese anyone?,e
or in any capacity where you just need a flavorful cracker.,i
Frankly once these are open it is hard to do anything but just eat them.,i
Definitely would purchase these,e
CheezIt has stepped up their taste with a great punch These have just enough kick.,i
The Chiptole flavor is amazing I highly recommend these.,i
If you love regular cheezits you will love these,e
CheezIts are one of the most delicious snack crackers out there.,e
But they should have quit while they were ahead.,e
The new Zingz line are designed to be even BOLDER in flavor.,i
Which I suppose they are too bad the flavor isn't good.,i
Its a blast of salt and not exactly a blast of flavor.,i
They are coated in some sort of salty spicy chipotle like powder that leaves your hands a mess although no worse than regular cheezits except you don't want to lick it off.,i
I admire the tenacity of a company whose goal is apparently to take up an entire grocery aisle with their products.,e
But this one is a loser.,e
if you already enjoy cheezit crackers you will no doubt enjoy this as well especially if you like a spicy kick to your food or snacks.highly recommended.,i
Ok i'm a certified cheezit nut.,e
My dad is too.,e
I have to put them away or pour them into a small bowl to keep myself from eating the whole box.,e
Then comes Zingz and i love them too.,e
This chipotle flavor is spicy but not too hot for people who don't like the heat.,i
They go great with lunch.,e
I'd say closest flavor is like taco spices.,i
Yummy.,i
These crackers are suprisingly good.,i
They don't taste like regular spicy cheezits as they are far crunchier due to being baked with masa corn flour.,i
This gives them a similar feel and taste to a tortilla chip but the Zingz have a much fuller body.,i
We ate a whole box on a trip to the beach.The chipotle flavor is not overpowering either.,i
I like spicy things and this cracker has just enough combination of cheesy and spicy.,i
My youngest son is not a big fan of spicy foods but he loved the Zingz.I have tried them with cream cheese dips and with queso dips and they were a nice match.,i
will buy them again and again for car trips tail gates and snacks.,e
First: we are cheezit fans.,e
My go to comfort food when I've had a bad day,e
Yes I could stand to lose a few pounds.,e
We like many of the new varieties of Cheezit.We quite liked these.,i
They are zesty.,i
They are spicy but not too spicy.,i
Good cheese flavour and good flavour of the pepper.,i
They are slightly less salty than cheezits and not as thick.,i
So they have a different mouth feel but it is all good.They are better than the Tobasco cheezits and are definitely worth a try if you are hunting for a zingy snack cracker.,i
I tried both the original and white cheddar versions of these cheezits and I preferred the white cheddar.,i
The original flavor was a little bland but the white cheddar had a good taste.,i
The strange thing about this size package is that it is too big to be a single serving but not really big enough to serve as more than 2 or 3 snacks.,e
It seems like a waste of packaging to make little containers that are too big to act as a single serving but not big enough to last very long.,e
Why not just buy a regular sized box and pour some into a small container if you want to pack them in a lunch or as an onthego snack?,e
These have the typical cheezit flavor.,i
However the best part about them was the size.,e
I could easily toss one into my daughter's school lunch for a snac.,e
There isn't much to say about the crackers they are the cheezit crackers we all love.,i
The packaging is the marketing item here the idea is a resealable lid that makes these convenient to throw in the cupholder of your car tractor desk airplane submarine bike stationary bike motorcycle unicycle train lawnmower flying piano flying carpet or hangglider.,e
This works well but the price is the only reason this gets three stars.,e
A box of cheezit crackers at the store is 13.7 oz for a couple dollars but the ten pack of cups is 22oz at 10 I have to hold recommendation and say get a tupperware cup and a box to get your salt fix.,e
Great idea but hard to see it being practical unless your kids can't do without.,e
Your typical cheezit packaged in a travel cup.,e
I was pretty unimpressed with these cups of crackers.They are fine as in the same crackers you would buy in a big box but they are nicely packaged in a cup with a lid on it.,e
I can see parents onthego using these at times maybe from a convenience store but I can't see buying them in bulk.I think I will stick with a big box and refill a cup that can be washed or a bag instead of creating tons of trash and spending extra money to pay for the special packaging.,e
My family and I love cheezits.,e
And chances are if you're looking at this product you already know you do too.,e
But I didn't like these  They had a weird unexpected taste kind of like when you have a snack sit too long in a sandwich bag and it absorbs the taste of the bag.,i
I'm not sure what part of the packaging it is but it's totally absorbing the flavoring of the packaging.,e
And honestly who wants to eat wouldbe delicious cheese crackers that taste like the plastic/cardboard they're packaged in? Cheezits are awesome and an onthego cup that is less likely to get all smashed up like the snack bags would be really nice.,e
But clearly they need to fix something  It makes me nervous to think what the crackers are absorbing that gives them such an awful taste.,e
I don't want to eat thatPlease try again Sunshine  Normally your products are awesome  In the mean time I'm going to stick with the regular boxes.,e
yummy bite size cheezits in a travel container.,e
each container comes with a lid so its portable even after you open it.,e
Great for long car rides.,e
I love CheezIt Cracker Cups I hate reaching into a bag when having a snack.,e
I always pour my popcorn into a bowl because of this.,e
That makes this cup a very convenient item for meIt's a nice size but a bit too big for one serving.,e
What do you do with the rest?,e
Share with a friend of course Easy to take along.,e
It holds up well but don't expect to put it in a backpack with a laptop or heavy books without the container getting smashed.,e
If you love cheezits you'll love it in a cup,e
I love cheezits but this just seems like incredibly wasteful and useless packaging.,e
It holds about two servings and the cuplike shape means it doesn't easily fit anywhere convenient like a purse or drawer.,e
I like that it has a lid but I can't find anything better to say about it than that.,e
I really like the taste of white cheddar cheezits.,i
It is mellow and not as harsh at the orginal flavor.,i
I really like that they now come in these cups.,e
I can toss it in my backpack without fear of it getting crushed like the cardboard boxes.,e
I have dropped .80 on a bag of cheezits half the size of this in the vending machine at work rarely...so this is about the same as buying the product from a vending machine only you store it at home.,e
You get twice as much for twice the price.,e
Or you could be smart and get five times as much for a quarter the price by buying a box.,e
Baggies are .0025 a piece...so save some dough and buy a box.Cheezits are yummy don't waste your money on this cup unless you are storing your togo cheezits where they will be whacked around a lot.,e
I am not the best of granola bar connoisseur' ..,e
I tried this with coffee this morning.,i
My first reaction was is it stale?,i
but I think that is the intended texture and consistency as the package was well sealed.,e
I get it a lot of granola bars are chewy but this seemed a little stale somehow.,i
I guess it's not dissimilar to rice krispies treats et al.The peanut butter and chocolate taste is not at all overwhelming which is nice.,i
Mostly you taste the grains and maybe a bit of honey.,i
My bar came almost completely crumbled so I had to eat it like popcorn as opposed to a bar.,e
Not a bad thing but it will get messy.,e
There were crumbs.Truthfully it's not so bad.,e
I don't think I would willingly purchase it unless price became a good incentive.,e
But I finished it with breakfast for breakfast and I nodded approvingly.,i
We decided to try these to see if it would help simplify breakfast in the mornings.,e
Getting 3 young kids off to can become hectic especially when everyone is indecisive about what they are going to eat.,e
These cereal pouches seemed to be a new take on the minibox variety pack from my youth.The huge advantage of this new set is no crappy ones raisin bran special k etc.,e
Those were always the last ones to be eaten.... if ever.,i
Instead we get krave which my wife and I agreed seems more like a snack vs a breakfast.On the other hand the downside that we had is that the kids treated them all like snacks.,e
In 3 days they were all gone.,e
I honestly wanted to get upset but I am sure I did the same thing at that age.,e
Obviously the biggest flaw to these  is the price.,e
If you need the convenience then price shouldn't be an issue.,e
But if the package size doesn't matter you get a lot more for your money buying full boxes.Ultimately my recommendation is to buy these only if you really need small portable servings.,e
I really enjoyed these cereals.,i
Just the right size snacks for the kids.,e
Good price great quality.,e
I just wasn't so impressed with the chocolate krave but love the apple jacks and fruit loops.,e
This 20 pack of 5 different cereals is great on the go when you're having hunger pangs and need to wait it out a little longer for whatever reason or to give to children.,e
For an adult 1 pouch is enough to satisfy a craving but not enough to keep you full.,e
As a 118 pound female I needed 2 pouches with milk to feel full.Most of us have already eaten fruit loops apple jacks and corn pops so a review of those individual flavors are not really needed.,e
If you have never eaten Krave I haven't before the pouches came along and you are a big fan of chocolate then the double chocolate Krave is the best of the two and will have you coming back for more.Because the pouches take up a lot of space its hard to organize them since you can't stack them like you do with boxes.,e
So my resolve is to put it in a grocery bag and just grab and go as needed.,e
Quite a few years ago we went with microwave popcorn as our popcorn of choice.,e
It tastes good and is oh so easy.,i
So it was rather on a lark that I picked up some of Kernel Season's Popping Corn.We cooked up the popcorn in a pan the old fashioned way and the young ones who had never actually seen corn pop were quite entertained watching it happen.,e
That brought back memories of my own childhood The corn popped up quite nicely with very few unpopped kernels left in the pan.,e
Yeah I think that this is a very good popping corn.,e
If you want to pop corn the old fashioned way then don't cheap out and get crappy popping corn get Kernel Season's Popping CornLet me make a recommendation here: a real good taste combination is this popping corn andSan Francisco Salt Company's Cherrywood Smoked Sea Salt.,e
Try itReview of Kernel Season's Popping Corn,e
This corn pops into really nice freshtasting puffs.,e
Rather than using oil in a pan or an air popper we used a paper bag in the microwave.,e
The results are just as easy to achieve as with the prepackaged microwave stuff ,e
The proportion of unpopped kernels was very small.,e
The packaging is convenient too.,e
This oil can be used to add a buttery flavor to previously popped popcorn like from a microwave popcorn packet.But you can use the real thing butter which I guarantee tastes like butter.This blend of soybean sunflower and canola oil is NOT low fat 14 g fat per 1 tsp serving 2g of that is saturated fat.,i
It does not contain a measurable source of protein even though the main ingrediant is soybeans or oil made from soybeans.So the best use is to put this in a traditional corn popper along with unpopped popping corn.,i
In this application butter will burn before the corn pops This Kernal Seasons Movie Theater Butter oil will not burn unless you apply excessive heat.And yes after the corn is popped it will have a residual flavor similar to butter.,i
I am a white cheddar lover always pick white cheddar mac and cheese  white cheddar cheezit crackers always always alwaysWell you know what it the absolute best about this sprinkle on white cheddar seasoning besides the explosion of wonderful white cheddar taste  ......,i
I can put on as much as I want  ever get your nacho chips or ranch chips with not quit enough cheese.... Kernels Seasons carries nacho and ranch as well as 34;my34; white cheddar never again will you be disappointed with not enough of that wonderful tangy flavor  this is a cheese lovers dream come true.,i
